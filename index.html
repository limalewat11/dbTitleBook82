The authors assume readers have a background in organic chemistry at the level of the typical two-semester college course. Although enzymes are crucial to biological reactions, the authors&#x2019; focus always remains on the reactivity patterns of the substrate molecules and on the organic, arrow-pushing details of the individual reactions.</p><p>The authors begin the book with a brief review chapter on the fundamental organic reaction mechanisms commonly found in biochemical pathways. Following this brush up on reaction mechanisms is a general introduction to the main classes of biomolecules. Then comes the heart of the book: full chapters devoted to the major metabolic pathways of the main classes of biomolecules&#x2014;lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, nucleotides, and secondary metabolites. In the course of these chapters, readers cover the chemistry of the common coenzymes, see examples of the common sorts of biological transformations, and ultimately begin to develop an understanding of the patterns found throughout bioorganic chemistry. The authors conclude with a summary of the reaction patterns and mechanisms frequently used in nature to effect chemical transformations, followed by a brief chapter summarizing some general themes of enzymatic catalysis.</p><p>All mechanisms have been updated in this second edition, and several hundred references to recent literature are given for those students who want more detail.</p></p><p><p><b>John E.

The essential Zen in book form, they say, would "more likely consist of blank pages; a reader fills them in. Or not." <p> But what a blessing that Tanahashi and Schneider, like others in Zen's long and prolific literary tradition, have nonetheless decided to spill a little ink and attempt to point toward that which cannot be told. In this lively little volume, they bring together some treasures of classical and contemporary wisdom that capture the enigmatic soul of Zen. Included are familiar works from classical masters--haiku by Japanese poet Basho, stories from philosopher Dogen, poems by Chinese recluse Hanshan, and koans and meditations by monks and nuns dating from the 5th century. And placed alongside "on equal footing" with the works of venerated Asian teachers are writings by contemporary Westerners--from poet Gary Snyder to students from Zen centers around the United States and Europe--emphasizing the fresh spirit or "nowness" of the tradition. At turns deeply serious, poignant, and humorous, the selections cover a wide range of concerns, from the inevitability of death to the importance of environmental stewardship. But all have in common a rootedness in the physical present while recognizing its fleeting nature; there is a freedom, they seem to say, that comes in appreciating but not clinging to the things of this world. Each piece is presented "clean," without accompanying commentary, but the editors' excellent endnotes give valuable biographical information and background on unfamiliar concepts. More than an accessible introduction to Zen for Westerners, this is a collection to be read for its insight into what it means to be human in a changing world. <i>--Uma Kukathas</i></p>Kazuaki Tanahashi is an artist, translator, and writer whose books include <i>Moon in a Dewdrop: Writings of Zen Master Dogen</i> and <i>Brush Mind</i>. <p>Tensho David Schneider is an ordained Zen priest and the author of <i>Street Zen</i>.</p></p><h2>The West European Party System (Oxford Readings in Politics and Government)</h2><p>The analysis of party systems in Western Europe has long constituted a major focus of concern in comparative political science. Now for the first time, many of the classic writings in this field have been collected into a single volume. The collection contains seminal writings by Weber, Neumann, Duverger, Kirchheimer, Daalder, Rokkan, and Sartori, as well as a selection from the more recent debates on changes in European party systems, including the contributions of Pedersen, Wolinetz, and Inglehart. The writings cover the development, stabilization, and transformation of party systems and include some of the key analyses which have sought to distinguish between different types of party systems.<br></p><p>Peter Mair is at University of Leiden.<br>"This volume is quite likely the best single compilation of 'classic' texts on parties in print today. Students of non-European party systems will also find much here to enjoy."--John J. Coleman, <em>University of Texas, Austin</em><p></p><br>"Excellent coverage of the major issues facing Western Europe today. This is a 'must-read' book for any student wanting more than a cursory description of European parties."--Michael A. Jogerst, <em>University of Iowa</em><p></p><br>"An excellent supplementary to a follow-up course in Western European politics."--John H. Hurley, <em>Catholic University of America</em><p></p><br>"Simply the best collection of essays on Western Europe available. An excellent source for both undergraduate and graduate students."--Jeffery Jackson, <em>SUNY at Buffalo</em><p></p><br>"Still one of the best texts for introducing students to the study of political parties."--<em>Matthew Doppke, Washington University-University College</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Material Culture :</h2><p>Noted scholar Henry Glassie (Passing the Time in Ballymenone, Turkish Traditional Art Today), directs his attention to reinventing and reinvigorating thistory and art through the study of material culture. As Glassie puts it, &#34;The concept of culture seems a secure achievements. In the future, history and art, as well as science and philosophy, will be understood to be, like culture, the creations of people who are alike in humanity, but different in tradition and predicament.&#34;</p><p>Henry Glassie is College Professor of Folklore and Co-director of Turkish Studies at Indiana University, where he has adjunct appointments in Central Eurasian Studies, Middle Eastern Studies, and American Studies. His books include Passing the Time in Ballymenone, Turkish Traditional Art Today, and Art and Life in Bangladesh, all available from Indiana University Press, as well as several other titles.</p><h2>Isaiah 13-39 (1974): A Commentary (Old Testament Library)</h2><p><p>Now available in a new casebound edition is Otto Kaiser's commentary on Isaiah, chapters 13-39.</p><p>The Old Testament Library provides fresh and authoritative reatments of important aspects of Old Testament study through commentaries and general surveys. The contributors are scholars of international standing.</p></p><p>This volume completes the three-volume commentary treatment of the book of Isaiah in this series. A present-day reader will normally open the book of Isaiah in order to learn something about the activity and preaching of the prophet who lived in the eighth century. He will, of course, find what he is looking for in this commentary, in so far as it endeavours to identify the primary material from the prophet.<p><b>Otto Kaiser</b> is <br>Professor Emeritus of Old <br>Testament at Philipps <br>University of Marburg in <br>Germany.</p></p><h2>Giorgio Morandi: Late Paintings</h2><p>One of the most beloved painters of the twentieth century, Giorgio Morandi created works that continue to exert their mysterious power on viewers worldwide. This publication focuses on the period from 1948 to 1964, during which Morandi developed and refined his investigations of serial, reductive, and permutational forms and compositions, a body of work that has had a profound influence on twentieth-century art and painting. Included here are five of the ten iconic &#x201c;yellow cloth&#x201d; paintings from 1952, a series featured prominently in the historic 1998 exhibition at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, and numerous late paintings by the Italian master. Lavishly reproduced, these immersive plates draw attention to the idiosyncratic perspectival and color-driven decisions that give the work its abstract power. The catalogue is published on the occasion of the 2015 exhibition of Morandi&#x2019;s paintings from this period at David Zwirner, New York&#x2014;which, according to The New York Times, represent &#x201c;lucid perfection, at once cerebral and impassioned.&#x201d; It marked the first major presentation of the artist&#x2019;s late work in America since the acclaimed 2008 retrospective at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. In addition to an essay by Laura Mattioli and a foreword by David Leiber, who organized the exhibition, this catalogue includes a fantastic array of contributions by contemporary artists: John Baldessari, Lawrence Carroll, Vija Celmins, Mark Greenwold, Liu Ye, Wayne Thiebaud, Alexi Worth, and Zeng Fanzhi. They offer their personal responses to Morandi&#x2019;s work and to the Zwirner exhibition in particular. Working in different media across many disciplines, this diverse list of contributors is a testament to the reach of Morandi&#x2019;s paintings and their influence on contemporary art.</p><p>Giorgio Morandi was born in 1890 in Bologna, Italy, where he lived until his death in 1964. Over the course of his five-decade career, Morandi was most prolific during the postwar years from the late 1940s until the 1960s, when he executed more than half of his entire output of paintings. Remaining dedicated to the repertoire of subjects that had occupied him since the early 1910s, including tabletop still lifes of bottles, boxes, vases, and flowers, as well as occasional landscapes, his variations on a given compositional motif became more persistent, nuanced, and abstract in the later part of his life. Through subtle shifts in color, tone, scale, composition, and mark-making, Morandi was able to convey the ever-changing perceptual understanding and memory of the objects and spaces one encounters. In 1993, the Museo Morandi was established in Bologna, Italy, and is currently located in the Museo d&#x2019;Arte Moderna di Bologna.</p><h2>Women&#39;s Health: A Primary Care Clinical Guide</h2><p><p>Fully updated to reflect the latest standards of care, this easy-to-use handbook brings together complete information on women&#x2019;s healthcare and health promotion.

The author describes the biological evolution of Earth&#x2019;s organisms, and reconstructs their adaptations to the life they led, and the ecology and environment in which they functioned. On the grand scale, Earth is a constantly changing planet, continually presenting organisms with challenges. Changing geography, climate, atmosphere, oceanic and land environments set a stage in which organisms interact with their environments and one another, with evolutionary change an inevitable result. The organisms themselves in turn can change global environments: oxygen in our atmosphere is all produced by photosynthesis, for example. The interplay between a changing Earth and its evolving organisms is the underlying theme of the book.<br> &nbsp;<br> The book has a dedicated website which explores additional enriching information and discussion, and provides or points to the art for the book and many other images useful for teaching.

Today, as the hundredth anniversary of the Great War prompts renewed debate about the war's causes, scholars and policy experts are also considering the parallels between the present international system and the world of 1914. Are China and the United States fated to follow in the footsteps of previous great power rivals? Will today's alliances drag countries into tomorrow's wars? Can leaders manage power relationships peacefully? Or will East Asia's territorial and maritime disputes trigger a larger conflict, just as rivalries in the Balkans did in 1914?</p><p>In<i> The Next Great War?</i>, experts reconsider the causes of World War I and explore whether the great powers of the twenty-first century can avoid the mistakes of Europe's statesmen in 1914 and prevent another catastrophic conflict. They find differences as well as similarities between today's world and the world of 1914&#x2015;but conclude that only a deep understanding of those differences and early action to bring great powers together will likely enable the United States and China to avoid a great war.</p><p><b>Contributors<br></b>Alan Alexandroff, Graham Allison, Richard N.

Unlike the poem&#x2019;s major precursors, the Greek epics of Homer, the <i>Aeneid</i> aims to illuminate the historical and cultural complexity of the world that surrounded its first audience. The poem looks back to the prehistory of Rome and forward to the Rome of Vergil&#x2019;s day, a perspective that has led some to characterize it as nostalgic. Yet the real beauty and strength of the work lies in its ability to provide a glimpse of the underpinnings of the very world its early audience inhabited&#x2014;both its strengths and its weaknesses. It is, in short, a poem that in taking us back to the origins of the Roman people takes us forward to the world of Vergil and, to a large extent, to the world we live in today. The theme of the poem is not so much a lament over the necessity of sacrifice, as it is sometimes read, but an assertion that loss is embedded in the imperial vision&#x2014;that the intertwined strands of promise and loss lie at the heart of the imperial enterprise, be it Augustan or contemporary. <br><br><br>Aeneas&#x2019; importance derives from two sources. On the one hand, it is fated in the <i>Iliad</i> (20.302) that he will escape Troy and his offspring will rule over fellow Trojans. Vergil connects Aeneas&#x2019; rule with Rome, and thus establishes a clear movement of the gods and so of culture from east to west, from Troy to Latium. Alongside this, as we are told in the first book by Jupiter,<b> </b>the king of the gods, and in the sixth book by Anchises, Aeneas&#x2019; father, that Aeneas is genealogically linked to Caesar, to whom Jupiter has granted an empire without end. Through Aeneas&#x2019; son Ascanius, also known as Iulus, the line of the Caesars will be founded; they will trace their family back to Venus, Aeneas&#x2019; mother, and Jupiter, her father.<br>The poem is often approached through the opposition offered in the opening lines between <i>pietas</i> (the honor man pays god and son pays father) and <i>furor</i> (rage). Aeneas is first characterized as a man marked by piety, while his primary antagonist, the goddess Juno, is marked by her rage. Throughout the poem, the struggles to achieve the goal of reaching Rome play out between these opposing forces. Aeneas&#x2019; honor of both his father and the gods&#x2014;dominated by the figure of Jupiter, the king of the gods&#x2014;propels him out of Troy and through years on the ocean; it is the reason he leaves the beautiful Dido, whom he encounters in Carthage; it is the mark of his leadership during the games on Sicily and his battles in Italy. <i>Furor</i>, on the other hand, accounts not only for the rage of Juno, Jupiter&#x2019;s wife and sister (angry because the victory of her Greeks at Troy has not destroyed the Trojans), but also for a series of characters who participate in that anger, including Dido, once spurned by Aeneas, and Turnus, whose land and betrothed are offered by his king to Aeneas. The progress of pius Aeneas from Troy to Latium is impeded by Juno and the characters in whom she inspires <i>furor</i>. <br>The interaction of <i>pietas</i> and <i>furor </i>plays out against the background of the imperial landscape. As Aeneas travels from Troy to Latium he sketches out the reach of the later empire, and in so doing, he lays his people&#x2019;s future claim to that path. Key landings that will later become part of the Roman imperial project are noted. Having Aeneas land at Buthrotum, for example, Vergil lays the groundwork for the later development of a Roman colony there. When, at the end of book 5, Aeneas decides to leave some of the older Trojans on Sicily, Vergil not only explains the presence of Trojan archeological finds there; he also justifies the development of Sicily as a Roman province. The stop at Actium, brief though it is, introduces Actium into the imperial language and projects Octavian&#x2019;s victory there. The lands Aeneas touches become marked for the imperial cause&#x2014;they are lands that the emperor will later claim as his own. Aeneas will see them only as false Italys; they mean nothing to him except failure, both to obtain his goal and to return home. Yet that very failure offers proof that the imperial project is underway.<br>The literary past participates in this enterprise. Vergil&#x2019;s literary models are many. On the one hand, there are the Greek epics of Homer, whose <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey </i>took four times as many books to relay their story; on the other, there is the newer movement of Alexandrian poetry (including both Apollonius&#x2019; <i>Argonautica </i>and the works of Callimachus), whose spare aesthetics argued that less is more, that recondite allusion and sharp delineation were the marks of cleaner, better poetry. Against these Greek traditions lies the Latin project: starting with Ennius, whose epic about the founding of Rome exists only in fragments, the tradition of telling Roman origins in Latin and highlighting the connection of the language to the Roman mission and identity was taken up by Lucretius and continued throughout the republic and into the empire, with the poetry of Catullus, Horace, Propertius, Tibullus, Vergil and Ovid. Every one of these poets aimed to grapple with the inherited Greek past in an effort not only to recast the works into a new language but, more, to show that that new literature was essential to the success and definition of the Roman mission.</p><h2>Options Made Easy: Your Guide To Profitable Trading</h2><p><p>In <b>Options Made Easy</b>, Second Edition, Guy Cohen clearly explains everything you need to know about options in plain English so that you can start trading fast and make consistent profits in any market, bull or bear!</p> <p>Simply and clearly, the author reveals secrets of options trading that were formerly limited to elite professionals&#x2013;and exposes the dangerous myths that keep investors from profiting.</p> <p>As you set out on your options journey, you'll learn interactively through real-life examples, anecdotes, case studies, and pictures.

The forty essays collected in <i>Living and Sustaining a Creative Life</i> are written in the artists&#x2019; own voices and take the form of narratives, statements, and interviews. Each story is different and unique, but the common thread is an ongoing commitment to creativity, inside and outside the studio. Both day-to-day and big picture details are revealed, showing how it is possible to sustain a creative practice that contributes to the ongoing dialogue in contemporary art. These stories will inform and inspire any student, young artist, and art enthusiast and will help redefine what "success" means to a professional artist.<br></p><p><b>Sharon Louden</b> is an editor, educator, advocate, and a practicing, professional artist.

Louden makes an important contribution to the discussion of how art is made now by the vast majority of artists at work. The book is a reality check prompting us to recall that invention doesn&#x2019;t happen without determination.

From artists living off sales of their work to those who teach and those who search for paychecks in odd jobs, the desire to create is never extinguished.&#x201d; <br> (Franklin Sirmans, Terri and Michael Smooke Curator, Los Angeles County Museum of Art)<br><br>&#x201c;From surprisingly frank sharings on the struggles of starting out as young artists to the challenges of making time and space for creation, the artists in <i>Living and Sustaining a Creative Life</i> share with candor and heart just what it takes to be an artist today." <br> (Anne Pasternak, president and artistic director, Creative Time)<br><br>&#x201c;Sharon Louden has gathered together in this book an exceptionally diverse range of artists&#x2019; experiences in order to illustrate, in a manner otherwise inaccessible, the inherent tensions that artists face in constantly balancing their drive to devote core time and energy to creating new work and their wish to share that work with the world with the complexities, as well as the joys, of their personal and family lives.&#x201d; <br> (Michael Straus, chairman, Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts)<br><br>&#x201c;I applaud artist Sharon Louden for assembling this fascinating compilation of artist testimonies. It provides a refreshing, honest look at the myriad ways that artists shape and feed their lives and evolve authentic, generative practices in a society that does not always make it easy for artists to subsist and fully contribute. <i>Living and Sustaining a Creative Life</i> is thus an inspiring, unexpurgated resource for artists beginning their careers as well as any individual seeking to recalibrate his or her daily life to pursue a more purpose-filled existence.&#x201d; <br> (Olga Viso, executive director, Walker Art Center)<br><br>"Louden&#x2019;s collection offers valuable lessons on striking a balance between the need to make money and the need to make art; for if making art is the primary concern, making money becomes a means to an end&#x2015;not the end itself. . . . Though written about the unique experience of fine artists, <i>Living and Sustaining A Creative Life</i> is worth the read by anyone seeking to build a life of artistic intention without ignoring the need for monetary sustenance."

The sheer number of false rumors and downright lies disseminated about the man and his films is truly astonishing. Yet Herzog's body of work is one of the most important in postwar European cinema.<br> His international breakthrough came in 1973 with <i>Aguirre, the Wrath of God</i>, in which Klaus Kinski played a crazed Conquistador. For<i> The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser</i>, Herzog cast in the lead a man who had spent most of his life institutionalized, and two years later he hypnotized his entire cast to make <i>Heart of Glass</i>. He rushed to an explosive volcanic Caribbean island to film <i>La Soufriï¿½re</i>, paid homage to F. W. Murnau in a terrifying remake of <i>Nosferatu</i>, and in 1982 dragged a boat over a mountain in the Amazon jungle for <i>Fitzcarraldo</i>. More recently, Herzog has made extraordinary "documentary" films, such as <i>Little Dieter Needs to Fly</i>. His place in cinema history is assured, and Paul Cronin's volume of dialogues provides a forum for Herzog's fascinating views on the things, ideas, and people that have preoccupied him for so many years.<br> This revised edition features new interviews discussing Herzog's films up to <i>From One Second to the Next</i> (2013), as well as additional text from Herzog, his collaborator Herbert Golder, the physicist Lawrence Krauss, and the filmmaker Harmony Korine.</p></p><p><b>Werner Herzog </b>has directed more than sixty films, notably <i>Aguirre, the Wrath of God</i>; <i>The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser</i>; <i>Fitzcarraldo</i>; <i>Little Dieter Needs to Fly</i>; <i>Grizzly Man</i>; and <i>Cave of Forgotten Dreams. </i>He is the author of several books, including <i>Conquest of the Useless</i>, and has staged more than a dozen operas around the world.<br><b>Paul Cronin </b>is the editor of the filmmaker trilogy: Lessons withKiarostami, Werner Herzog: A Guide for the Perplexed, and AlexanderMackendrick's On Film-Making: An Introduction to the Craft of theDirector. He has made films about Amos Vogel, Peter Whitehead andHaskell Wexler's Medium Cool. His website is filmmakertrilogy.com. <i></i><p>&#x201c;[A] magnificent volume of interviews. . .

John Hollander, the eminent poet and critic, has selected more than fifty works of art&#x2014;paintings, prints, drawings, photographs, and sculptures from antiquity to the present&#x2014;and matched them to poems that address the same images in their verses. The result is an illuminating and ingeniously organized chronicle of words and images in conversation, as well as a powerful introduction to how, across Western culture, great writers have been inspired by pictures.<br><br><i>The Gazer's Spirit</i> focuses on leading examples of ecphrastic poetry, or poems that directly confront particular works of art. Hollander, who is one of the most distinguished contemporary practitioners of the ecphrastic tradition, has crafted a survey of enormous range, taste, and depth, from the Renaissance to the twentieth century. The heart of the book is its gallery of poems and images set side by side.<br><br>There are poems whose presence in this book is all but inevitable, such as Auden's "Musee des Beaux Arts" paired with Breugel the Elder's <i>Landscape with the Fall of Icarus</i>, and delightful surprises, such as Edith Wharton's sonnet that casts fresh light on Leonardo's <i>Mona Lisa</i>. Here are Robert Browning and Michelangelo; Walt Whitman and George Inness; and Randall Jarrell and Albrecht Dï¿½rer writing and drawing about <i>The Knight, Death and the Devil.</i><br><br>Among the poets are many visually sophisticated writers such as James Merrill, Richard Howard, Marianne Moore, and Richard Wilbur; the visual objects in the book are both celebrated and obscure, as various as a Greek sculplture, a medieval tapestry, a famous Renoir, or a fountain by an anonymous architect. In some cases, obvious affinities, such as a poem by Vicki Hearne on a white horse by Gauguin, produce unexpected poetic results.</p><p><b>John Hollander</b> (1929&#x2013;2013) was the Sterling Professor of English at Yale University and the author of more than thirty books of poetry and literary criticism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On The Luxembourg Gallery <i>by Washington Allston</i><br> If Famous Apelles With His Hand Of Art <i>by Pietro Aretino</i><br> Musee Des Beaux Arts <i>by Wystan Hugh Auden</i><br> From My Ancient Rock <i>by Filippo Baldinucci</i><br> Gypsies On The Move <i>by Charles Baudelaire</i><br> To The Bartholdi Statue <i>by Ambrose Bierce</i><br> Art Is The True And Happy Science Of The Soul <i>by Robert Seymour Bridges</i><br> For The Picture, 'the Last Of England' <i>by Ford Madox Brown</i><br> Hiram Powers' Greek Slave <i>by Elizabeth Barrett Browning</i><br> The 'moses' Of Michael Angelo <i>by Robert Browning</i><br> Arches On Arches <i>by George Gordon Byron</i><br> The Statue Of Apollo <i>by George Gordon Byron</i><br> The Vatican <i>by George Gordon Byron</i><br> 'the Man With The Hoe'; A Reply <i>by John Vance Cheney</i><br> The Rokeby Venus <i>by George Robert Acworth Conquest</i><br> Upon Fairford Windows <i>by Richard Corbett</i><br> Brueghel's Winter <i>by Walter John De La Mare</i><br> After Watteau <i>by Henry Austin Dobson</i><br> The Statue Of Medusa <i>by William Drummond Of Hawthornden</i><br> 'se Aprovechan' <i>by Irving Feldman</i><br> Cythera <i>by David Ferry</i><br> The Embarkation For Cythera <i>by David Ferry</i><br> Plate 134.

The key contrasts created are finally less those between wealth and poverty, or capitalists and workers, than those between the head and the heart, between &#x201c;Fact&#x201d;&#x2015;the cold, rationalistic approach to life that Dickens associates with utilitarianism&#x2015;and &#x201c;Fancy&#x201d;&#x2015;a warmth of the imagination and of the feelings, which values individuals above ideas.</p> <p> Concentrated and compressed in its narrative form, <em>Hard Times</em> is at once a fable, a novel of ideas, and a social novel that seeks to engage directly and analytically with political issues.

Wade</i>, it's crucial to look back to the time when abortion was illegal. Leslie Reagan traces the practice and policing of abortion, which although illegal was nonetheless widely available, but always with threats for both doctor and patient. In a time when many young women don't even know that there was a period when abortion was a crime, this work offers chilling and vital lessons of importance to everyone.<br><br>The linking of the words "abortion" and "crime" emphasizes the difficult and painful history that is the focus of Leslie J. Reagan's important book. Her study is the first to examine the entire period during which abortion was illegal in the United States, beginning in the mid-nineteenth century and ending with <i>Roe v. Wade</i> in 1973. Although illegal, millions of abortions were provided during these years to women of every class, race, and marital status. The experiences and perspectives of these women, as well as their physicians and midwives, are movingly portrayed here.<br><br>Reagan traces the practice and policing of abortion. While abortions have been typically portrayed as grim "back alley" operations, she finds that abortion providers often practiced openly and safely. Moreover, numerous physicians performed abortions, despite prohibitions by the state and the American Medical Association. Women often found cooperative practioners, but prosecution, public humiliation, loss of privacy, and inferior medical care were a constant threat.<br><br>Reagan's analysis of previously untapped sources, including inquest records and trial transcripts, shows the fragility of patient rights and raises provocative questions about the relationship between medicine and law. With the right to abortion again under attack in the United States, this book offers vital lessons for every American concerned with health care, civil liberties, and personal and sexual freedom.</p><p>"Exploiting legal as well as medical records, Reagan has retrieved the history of women who struggled for reproductive autonomy and provides our best account of how the practice and policing of abortion evolved in relation to medicine, the state, and the condition of women. [This] is a major contribution to social history."&#x2014;James W. Reed, Rutgers University<br><br>"This is a fascinating book&#x2014;energetic, even urgent in its narrative. It is based on entirely new material, making ingenious and enlightening use of criminal trials, inquests and newspaper accounts. Both creative and painstaking in her research, Reagan persuasively establishes historical patterns in the availability of assisted abortion, and documents a striking anti-abortion backlash in the 1940-50s. In addition to the book's value for scholars, it will undoubtedly be valuable to feminists, lawyers, doctors,and others intersted in the conditions of abortion today."&#x2014;Nancy Cott, Yale University<br><br>"A first-rate exposition of the changing cultural and legal climate regarding abortion in America."&#x2014;Thomas Szasz, <i>Washington Post</i>&#34;Exploiting legal as well as medical records, Reagan has retrieved the history of women who struggled for reproductive autonomy and provides our best account of how the practice and policing of abortion evolved in relation to medicine, the state, and the condition of women. [This] is a major contribution to social history.&#34; (James W. Reed, Rutgers University)</p><h2>Trials of the Diaspora: A History of Anti-Semitism in England</h2><p><em>Trials of the Diaspora</em> is a ground-breaking book that reveals the full history of anti-Semitism in England. Anthony Julius focuses on four distinct versions of English anti-Semitism. He begins with the medieval persecution of Jews, which included defamation, expropriation, and murder, and which culminated in 1290 when King Edward I expelled all the Jews from England. Turning to literary anti-Semitism, Julius shows that negative portrayals of Jews have been continuously present in English literature from the anonymous medieval ballad "Sir Hugh, or the Jew's Daughter," through Shakespeare's <em>Merchant of Venice</em>, to T. S. Eliot and beyond. The book then moves to a depiction of modern anti-Semitism--a pervasive but contained prejudice of insult and exclusion that was experienced by Jews during their "readmission" to England in the mid-17th century through the late 20th century. The final chapters detail the contemporary anti-Semitism that emerged in the late 1960s and the 1970s and continues to be present today. It treats Zionism and the State of Israel as illegitimate Jewish enterprises, and, in Julius's opinion, now constitutes the greatest threat to Anglo-Jewish security and morale. A penetrating and original work, <em>Trials of the Diaspora</em> is sure to provoke much comment and debate.</p><p><br><strong>Anthony Julius</strong> is Chairman of the London Consortium, a Visiting Professor at Birkbeck College, University of London, and Vice-President of the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund. The author of several books, including <em>T. S. Eliot: Anti-Semitism and Literary Form</em>, he was the defense attorney in the renowned <em>Irving vs. Lipstadt</em> Holocaust denial case, and continues to be active in the fight against anti-Semitic activities.<br><br></p><h2>As You Like It: A Norton Critical Edition (Norton Critical Editions)</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;All the world&#x2019;s a stage.&#x201d; Shakespeare&#x2019;s beloved pastoral comedy is now available in a Norton Critical Edition.</strong></p> Since its return to the London stage in 1740, <em>As You Like It</em> has delighted theatergoers, readers, and critics.

Firstly, in keeping with the collection&#x2019;s aim to reflect contemporary preoccupations, the reader has expanded <i>forward</i> to include such newly emergent considerations as ecocriticism and post-theory. </p> <p>Secondly, with the aim of presenting as broad an account of modern theory as possible, the reader expands <i>backwards</i> to to take in exemplary pieces by formative writers and thinkers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries such as Marx, Freud and Virginia Woolf.. This radical expansion of content is prefaced by a wide-ranging introduction, which provides a rationale for the collection and demonstrates how connections can be made between competing theories and critical schools.</p> <p>The purpose of the&nbsp;collection remains that of introducing the reader to the guiding concepts of contemporary literary and cultural debate. It does so by presenting substantial extracts from seminal thinkers and surrounding them with the contextual materials necessary to a full understanding. Each selection has a headnote, which gives biographical details of the author and provides suggestions for further reading, and footnotes that help explain difficult references. The collection is ordered both historically and thematically and readers are encouraged to draw for themselves connections between essays and theories.&nbsp; </p> <p><i>Modern Criticism and Theory </i>has long been regarded as a necessary collection. Now revised for the twenty first century it goes further and provides students and the general reader with a wide-ranging survey of the complex landscape of modern theory and a critical assessment of the way we think &#x2013; and live &#x2013; in the world today.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><b> </b><p><b>David Lodge </b>is Emeritus Professor of English Literatureat the University of Birmingham, where he taught from 1960 until 1987.

Written by well-known and respected teachers and researchers in the field of Second Language Acquisition, Making Communicative Language Teaching Happen addresses important questions such as what it means to teach communicatively, what are proper roles of input and output in the classroom, how do learners read and write in a second language, and what approaches to testing and evaluation are appropriate for the communicative classroom. Making Communicative Language Teaching Happen begins by defining communicative language teaching and proceeds to explore its underlying assumptions, to examine the roles of teachers and learners, to discuss theoretical and research issues relating to it, and to offer practical suggestions. A Student Manual accompanies the text.</p><p>James F.

It is arranged by continent, and where possible, continents that are next to each other on the globe are next to each other on the chart, and each continent has a limited colour range, making it easily identifiable. Beneath the main chart is a timeline of important events and personalities in the past, including kings and queens, politicians, religious and cultural leaders and inventors.</p><p>This colourful and detailed chart will teach children about the many different events which have occurred in the few hundred years and is a perfect resource for any history class!</p><h2>Family Fortunes: Men and Women of the English Middle Class, 1780-1850 (Women in Culture and Society)</h2><p>"<i>Family Fortunes</i> is a major groundbreaking study that will become a classic in its field.

She is as renowned for her tantalising brand of Southern gothic humour as she is for her Catholicism - that these tendencies should be associated with her fiction is no surprise, but it is astonishing to see them revealed in illustrated form, featured now in the first ever book devoted to her visual art. The never-before-seen drawings within are both sophisticated and clever.</p><p>The images - rendered in black--and--white in a stylistically wobbly hand - demonstrate the thinly veiled dark humor and snappy dialogue O&#39;Connor would come to perfect in her short stories. She was often the butt of her own jokes: the none--too--perfect girl. . .

Framed for attempting to murder a Roman official, Ben-Hur is robbed of his freedom, family, and fortune. Condemned to death as a galley slave, he lives only to avenge himself against the Roman tribune Messala&#x2014;the boyhood friend who betrayed him.</p> <p><i>Ben-Hur</i> vividly recreates the sweep of Imperial Rome&#x2014;from a thrilling sea battle, to the famous chariot race, to the agony of the Crucifixion.

The saga of Judah Ben-Hur's spiritual journey from slavery to vengeance to redemption is both a vivid historical adventure and a powerful story of one man's religious awakening. As Blake Allmendinger writes in his Introduction to this Modern Library Paperback Classic, "<i>Ben-Hur </i>has endured for more than one hundred years because it offers something for everyone. The story of the Jewish hero Ben-Hur, his conflict with the Roman warrior Messala, and his conversion to Christianity at the foot of the Cross, combines adventure, sentimentality, athletic spectacle, and religious devotion."</p><h2>Alexander Hamilton: The Illustrated Biography</h2><p><b>Find out who lived and who died in the incredible story of the founding father who made America modern&#x2014;and became the toast of Broadway.</b><br> This richly illustrated biography portrays Alexander Hamilton&#x2019;s fascinating life alongside his key contributions to American history, including his unsung role as an early abolitionist.

You'll learn how to train, through practice, the part of your mind that comes up with words and arranges them into sentences. As you practice, you'll build your vocabulary and become more aware of what words can do, and you'll expand your repertoire of sentence techniques. The result? You'll become expert at creating powerful sentences--sentences that will grab your readers' attention and keep them turning pages.</p><p>My first book, <i>How To Be a Writer: Building Your Creative Skills Through Practice and Play</i>, focused on the skills writers must use in coming up with material for pieces of writing. But great ideas, scenes, characters, story--they aren't enough to keep people reading your work. You also have to produce excellent writing--that's what agents and editors are looking for.<br><br>Many aspiring writers believe only the talented few can produce great sentences. But that isn't true. In the scientific field of expertise studies, researchers have shown that talent has little to do with building expertise; what counts is dedication to deliberate practice. Just like experts in other fields, you can build and develop your skills in writing craft through guided practice and imitating models of excellence.<br><br>I developed this skills-building program for students in an MFA program in creative writing. Now, in <i>Spellbinding Sentences</i>, I make it available to writers of all kinds. Here you'll be shown what to practice, and how to practice, as you take one step after another along the path to writing mastery. With mastery comes the confidence that you know what you're doing as you write and revise. That confidence is available to anyone willing to put time and energy into practicing skills.Barbara Baig is the creator of The Mastery Path for Writers, an innovative way to&nbsp; develop writing expertise.

They know that real satisfaction and the good life cannot be provided by corporations, institutions, or systems. No number of great executives, central offices, technical innovations, or long-range plans can produce what a community can produce. People are discovering that satisfying possibilities for their lives are in the neighborhood, not in the marketplace.<br><br> In many nations, local people have come together to pursue a common calling. They are groups of local people who have the courage to discover their own way&#x2014;to create a culture made by their own vision. It is a handmade, homemade vision. And wherever we look, it is a culture that starts the same way, with an awakening:<br><br> First, we see the abundance that we have&#x2014;individually, as neighbors, and in this place of ours.<br><br> Second, we know that the power of what we have grows from creating new connections and relationships among and between what we have.<br><br> Third, we know that these connections are no accident. They happen when we individually or collectively act to make the connections&#x2014;they don&#x2019;t just happen by themselves.<br><br> We also know that these three steps, which awaken us to our abundance, not our scarcities, can often be undermined by great corporate, governmental, professional, and academic institutions. By their nature as systems, they say to us, &#x201c;You are inadequate, incompetent, problematic, or broken. We will fix you. Go back to sleep.&#x201d;<br><br> It is our calling as citizens to ignore the voices that create dependency, for we are called to find our own way&#x2014;not to follow their way.<br><br> Most all of us live in a democracy, a politics that gives us the freedom to create our vision and the power to make that vision come true. We strive to be citizens&#x2014;people with the vision and the power to create our own way, a culture of community capacity, connection, and care.<br><br> Unfortunately, many leaders and even some neighbors think the idea of a strong local community is something that&#x2019;s sort of &#x201c;nice,&#x201d; a luxury if you have the spare time, but not really important, vital, or necessary. However, we know from our work in communities around the globe that strong communities are vital, productive, and important. And above all, they are necessary because of the inherent limits of all institutions.<br><br> No matter how hard they try, our very best institutions cannot do many things that only we can do. And the things that only we can do as a family and a neighborhood are vital to a decent, good, satisfied life.<br><br> The Elements of Satisfaction<br><br> People in the movement know what only we have the power to do as local neighbors and citizens. All the elements of satisfaction grow out of an abundant community:<br><br> image Our neighborhoods are the primary source of our Health. How long we live and how often we are sick are determined by our personal behaviors, our social relationships, our physical environment, and our income. We are the people who can change these things, individually and with our neighbors. Medical systems and doctors cannot. This is why scientists agree that medical care accounts for a small proportion of what allows us to be healthy. Indeed, most informed medical leaders advocate for community health initiatives because they recognize that medical systems have reached the limits of their health-giving power.<br><br> image Whether we are Safe and Secure in our neighborhood is largely within our domain. Many studies show that there are two major determinants of our local safety.1 One is how many neighbors we know by name. The other is how often we are present and associated in public&#x2014; outside our houses. Police activity is a minor protection compared with these two community actions. This is why most informed police leaders advocate for block watch and community policing. They know their limits and call on citizens to become connected.<br><br> image The future of our earth&#x2014;the Environment&#x2014;is a major local responsibility. The &#x201c;energy problem&#x201d; is our local domain because how we transport ourselves, how we heat and light our homes, and how much waste we create are major factors in saving our earth. That is why this movement is a major force in calling us and our neighbors to be citizens of the earth and not just consumers of the natural wealth.<br><br> image In our neighborhoods and villages, we have the power to build a resilient Economy&#x2014; one less dependent on the megasystems of finance and production that have proved to be so unreliable. Most enterprise begins locally, in garages, basements, and dining rooms. The first dollars in any new business come from family and friends, not banks or venture capitalists. As families and neighbors, we have the local power to nurture and support these businesses so that they have a viable market. And we have the local power to preserve our own savings so that we are not captives of financial institutions.<br><br> We also are the most reliable sources of jobs, for in many nations, word of mouth among friends and neighbors is still the most important access to employment. The future of our economic security is now clearly a responsibility and growing necessity for local people.<br><br> image We are coming to see that we have a profound local responsibility for the Food we eat. We are allied with the local food movement, supporting local producers and markets. In this way, we do our part to solve the energy problem caused by transportation of food from continents away. We do our part to solve our economic problems by circulating our dollars locally. And we improve our health by eating food free of poisons, petroleum, and processing. This means that real health care reform is in our hands, not just in the hands of legislators and industries.<br><br> image We are local people who must raise our Children. We all say that it takes a village to raise a child. And yet, in modernized societies, this is rarely true. Instead, we pay systems to raise our children&#x2014; teachers, counselors, coaches, youth workers, nutritionists, doctors, and McDonald&#x2019;s.<br><br> We are often reduced as families to being responsible for paying others to teach, watch, and know our children, and to transport them to their paid child raisers. Our villages have often become useless&#x2014; our neighbors responsible for neither their children nor ours. As a result, everywhere we talk about the local &#x201c;youth problem.&#x201d; There is no &#x201c;youth problem.&#x201d; There is a neighborhood problem: adults who have forgone their responsibility and capacity to join their neighbors in sharing the wealth of children. It is our greatest challenge and our most hopeful possibility.<br><br> image Locally, we are the site of Care. Our institutions can offer only service&#x2014;not care&#x2014;for care is the freely given commitment from the heart of one to another; it cannot be purchased. As neighbors, we care for each other. We care for our children. We care for our elders. We care for those most vulnerable among us. It is this care that is the basic power of a community of citizens. Care cannot be provided, managed, or purchased from systems.<br><br> Health, safety, environment, economy, food, children, and care are the seven responsibilities of an abundant community and its citizens. They are the necessities that only we can fulfill. And when we fail, no institution or government can succeed. Because we are the veritable foundation of the society.<br><br> The Universal Properties<br><br> At the heart of our movement are three universal properties. A community becomes powerful and competent when it awakens these properties. They become the source of power in families and neighborhoods. Here are the three basics of our calling:<br><br> The Giving of Gifts&#x2014;The gifts of the people in our neighborhood are boundless. Our movement calls forth those gifts.<br><br> The Presence of Association&#x2014;In association we join our gifts together, and they become amplified, magnified, productive, and celebrated.<br> The Compassion of Hospitality&#x2014;We welcome strangers because we value their gifts and need to share our own. Our doors are open. There are no strangers here, just friends we haven&#x2019;t met.<br><br> These are the properties of a community of abundance. There is no limit to our gifts, our associations, and our hospitality.<br><br> This can all be considered a calling. We are the people who know what we need. What we need surrounds us. What we need is each other. And when we act together, we will create competence in our community and satisfaction in our lives.<br><br> We are called to nothing less. And it is not so wild a dream. It requires only that we create with our hands and in our homes what we once thought we could purchase.<br><br> A NOTE TO THE READER (YOU)<br><br> We want to define three terms we use interchangeably, even though they have different specific meanings; these are the terms association, neighborhood, and community. Here is how we mean them:<br><br> Association is three or more people who come together by choice and mostly without pay because of a common interest. The common interest may be simply to be together, or it may be to change the world.<br><br> A neighborhood is the place where you live and sleep. It could be your block or the square mile surrounding where you live. It may or may not have a name.<br><br> The word community is more difficult, but we use it as a general term to describe what occurs outside systems and institutions. It also refers to an aggregation of people or neighborhoods that have something in common. It is both a place and an experience of connectedness. When we use the term community competence, we mean the capacity of the place where we live to be useful to us, to support us in creating those things that can only be produced in the surroundings of a connected community. When we talk of a community way, it is all of the above: people outside institutions, connected by choice and usually affection, who together decide what they want to participate in creating.</p><h2>Socrates and Aristophanes</h2><p><p>In one of his last books, <i>Socrates and Aristophanes,</i> Leo Strauss's examines the confrontation between Socrates and Aristophanes in Aristophanes' comedies.

Thus, we come to Aristophanes, the great comic poet, and his attack on Socrates in the play <i>The Clouds.</i> . .

Drawing together works by Bartolomeo Manfredi, Valentin de Boulogne, Nicolas Tournier, Nicolas Rï¿½gnier, Cecco del Caravaggio, and the young Jusepe de Ribera, Michael Fried examines the nature of this later generation&#x2019;s engagement with Caravaggio. The magnitude and interest of their achievements have long been recognized, but existing scholarship has touched only the surface. Fried approaches his topic with seriousness and sophistication, revealing the density of meaning and sheer pictorial ambition in the works of the painters known as the Caravaggisti.<br> &nbsp;<br> Accessibly written, this beautifully illustrated book combines an account of works by Manfredi, Valentin, Tournier, Regnier, and Ribera with a detailed case study of Cecco del Caravaggio's <i>Resurrection</i> (1619&#x2013;20), and concludes by surveying a group of paintings by Guercino, a painter not counted among the Caravaggisti, but whose strategies in relation to the viewer aligned him with their interests. Fried moves with agility between broad and focused fields of vision. In his final remarks, he makes a compelling case for understanding these paintings in relation to the thought of Renï¿½ Descartes.</p><p>Renowned art historian Michael Fried explores the nature and meaning of artistic influence and brings to light the extraordinary achievements of a generation of Italian Baroque painters inspired by the example of Caravaggio.<br><p><b>Michael Fried</b> is J.

He was six feet tall and muscular despite his half-century. Of late, however, worry lay on his face. It was only January, but he knew already that 1822 would be a hard year. The papers piled on his study desk showed clearly that once again there would be little if any profit.He fingered the black band on his coat sleeve. It was two months since cholera had flared on the Sea Island plantations, two months since his alluring half-sister had died. If her death had eased some strains, it had brought others. Her children, for instance. Charlotte, nineteen, blond and pretty, was no problem, but Edward, almost fourteen ... Edward was a special problem.Reminding himself that he was to meet that morning with the executors of Catherine's estate, he decided to check the morning mail before leaving. The top letter was from New Orleans. He ripped it open.<i>My Dear Mr. Fallon,</i><i>I take pen in hand as representative of Le Garde, Thibodeau, La Fontaine and Smith, attorneys at law and executors of the late Esteban Lopes ...</i>The late Esteban Lopes, he thought in shock. Lopes had been a close friend, and a business associate. They had gone in the path of violent times together, before Robert had settled to being a merchant. He read on.<i>... . Among his papers were documents indicating he had undertaken certain sales for you, and was soon to forward the sum of seventy thousand, dollars in gold. Unfortunately, his estate is remarkably small, and quite unable to come near such an amount. I regret to inform you of this, but it ismy duty to say that Le Garde, Thibodeau, La Fontaine and Smith have no connection with any dealings that you may have had with Mr. Lopes, and can in no way be held accountable for these monies. If you wish to bring a claim against the estate ...</i>He let the letter drop. A friend was dead, and to his horror he could only think of the seventy thousand dollars. That money had been meant to cover projects already begun. At the foundry Kenneth Graham, his young Scottish engineer, was attempting to duplicate the process for making English steel. He'd had a new steamship, <i>Comet,</i> built for the express purpose of trying to make a profitable steam crossing of the Atlantic, something no one else had yet done. Damn it, he needed that money desperately. It was a good thing he was finally meeting Catherine's executors. He was certain to be made trustee of her estate for the children. That would tide him over, and the money could be repaid in a few years, long before the children were old enough to receive control.Abruptly he made a grimace of self-disgust. Was he that desperate, had he sunk that low, to risk their inheritance?Loud voices outside his door pulled him out of his funk. He went out to find the hall filled with gabbling children and maids. Albert Varley, the butler, a tall, thin man with blue-black skin, was trying to restore some semblance of order."What in blue blazes is going on here?" Robert shouted. Silence fell, all of them staring at him as if he had appeared by magic.Edward was the first to recover. "Nothing, sir. It was an accident, sir." Fallon blood had given him high cheekbones and blue eyes, but on him the eagle nose had softened its curve, and his hair was silky light brown ringlets.He had too much of his mother's looks, Robert thought, making him <i>too</i> handsome, almost pretty. "You up to some mischief, Edward?" he said. Please let it not be Edward this time, he thought. He loved the boy, but sometimes ..."Yes, he is," Elizabeth said loudly. Not yet six, she stepped defiantly out from her mauma's side, but one hand clutched the stout black woman's skirt. Named for Robert's mother, she had inherited the first Elizabeth's violet eyes in a pretty heart-shaped face beneath midnight curls. "Chloe was hurt, Papa."Chloe was one of the cook's assistants. Edward took on a sullen expression as Robert eyed him. "What happened to Chloe?""Just wanted to scare her," Edward muttered. "Just wanted to make her jump.""There was a brick, sir," Albert said carefully. He was young for abutler, only thirty-five, and educated beyond a butler's station. Moira had found him doing odd jobs for barely enough to stay alive, and hired him. Robert was under no illusions about Albert's first loyalty. "It ... fell, sir."Robert waited. Another fit of silence seemed to have taken everyone. Only the two smallest children in their maumas' arms were unaffected. Thomas, a year old, waved a chubby fist at him and gurgled, while Carver, at three, grinned and held out his arms. Each boy had a falcon's beak of a nose. Robert was briefly thankful, for Elizabeth's sake, that the nose seemed to pass the female Fallons by.Finally he said, "I take it this brick fell on Chloe?""That it did," Moira Fallon said, bustling into the hall. She was a small woman, slenderly built, with finespun black hair and an upturned nose. At thirty, ten years of marriage had given her a quiet dignity, but now her normally clear gray eyes flashed and an ominous touch of brogue was in her voice. "I'll be talking to you about this alone, husband."The children scurried out, maumas herding them, Edward's young valet at his heels."In my study," Robert said resignedly. This wasn't the first discussion they'd had about Edward, and it was making out to be as unpleasant as the rest.He held the door for her, then settled in a wingchair while she paced before the fire. "He dropped a brick from the second-floor porch," she said without preamble, "and hit Chloe as she was coming down the back stair. She's a gash down the side of her head, and if the brick had been an inch to the right, it would've killed her. It's a wonder she didn't break her neck tumbling down the stair.""Why, I'll blister ..." He drew a deep breath. Punishment did little except make Edward more sullen. "Boys sometimes do rough things," he said awkwardly. "You'll find out when Carver and Thomas are older.""Will they be tripping a friend down a well, breaking his leg?" she said conversationally. "Will they be talking another friend into trying to ride a stallion in rut? There was a broken arm out of that, and a fractured jaw. Will they be putting a coral snake in the butler's bed?""He thought it was a king snake, Moira. An easy enough mistake to make. Besides, Albert wasn't hurt.""Robert, that boy is a bastard by birth and by temperament. I will not have him in my house.""You seem to forget I'm a bastard, too. If my father hadn't taken me in--""You weren't Michael Fallon's bastard by his half-sister!"He flinched. "For God's sake, how many times does that have to be brought up? You know I've never made excuses, but she could reach insideme, twist my thoughts till I didn't know what I was doing. God knows I tried to break away, but she ... It was Edward gave me the strength. The horror of it. That gave me just enough strength to flee Charleston.""I know," she murmured. Her slender fingers brushed his brow."Pacific typhoons and Malay pirates seemed no more than fitting payment for ... And then there was you. You gave me the strength to return to Charleston, the strength to resist Catherine's witch-powers. Don't you see, Moira, it'd be all too easy for me to turn my back on Edward, but I can't. The only expiation I can make is to try to make certain he grows up to be a fine man. Don't you see? I must."There had been a moment when he thought she might be relenting, but that moment had passed.She drew a shuddering breath. "It's out of the house I want him, Robert. It isn't his birth, or maybe it is, but there is something frightening about him. He does things, and people are hurt, and he doesn't care. He scares me, Robert.""You're letting your imagination run away with--""I know what I feel! He must go!" She had rounded on him with her fists clenched, and he found himself on his feet facing her."I say he stays!" He knew his face was carved in stone."In that case, husband," she said coldly, "we must attend the Alyards' party tomorrow night. We have already accepted. But I will thank you to move your things into one of the guest rooms." She slammed the door behind her.Why wouldn't she understand? he thought. She knew it all. About James, too, his other son. Long before he met her, he had been going to marry Louise de Chardonnay, just as soon as he returned from a voyage to France. Only the Barbary pirates had intervened, and after two years in a North African quarry he'd returned to Charleston to find Louise had borne him a son, James. Almost to the last she had waited, then, sure he was dead, she had married Martin Caine and gone to Louisiana. He had never been able to find the boy--man, now, if he was alive--though he kept New Orleans lawyers on retainer to try. Surely Moira could understand that he couldn't abandon Edward, too.The chiming of the clock reminded him of his appointment, and with an oath he hurried to get his hat and walking stick.James DeSaussure's offices occupied a two-story brick building on Meeting Street. A discreet brass plaque near the door proclaimed that James DeSaussure was an attorney at law. He was also something of a banker, or moneylender, for merchants, factors, and planters of sufficient solvency, something that wasn't mentioned on the plaque.The door was opened by a stooped, chocolate-brown man in the blacksuit of a butler who ushered Robert inside and took his curly brimmed beaver and gold-headed stick. "Mr. DeSaussure is expecting you, sir."Robert followed him upstairs. The room looked more like a drawing room than an office, with a fine Turkey rug on the floor, Chippendale chairs scattered about, and a fire burning beneath a carved marble mantel."Thank you for coming, Mr. Fallon." DeSaussure's bass voice belied his size. He was a small man, almost delicate, with tiny hands and feet, and deep-set eyes that gave him the appearance of timidity. The appearance was misleading. DeSaussure had twice faced his man on the field of honor. "You know Oliver Huger, don't you?"Huger, a dark-complected, frog-faced man with tiny ears and thick lips, jerked a nod. "Mr. Fallon." He regarded Robert unpleasantly."A chair, Mr. Fallon?" DeSaussure said. "We can do our business over a glass of wine, certainly. Madeira? Or port?""Madeira," Robert said. He sat, taking the glass DeSaussure handed him, and waited for them to begin."First," DeSaussure said, "let me apologize in advance. Your sister's will is still in probate, of course, but I fear I must tell you that you are not to be the trustee.""Not!" A little of the wine slopped onto Robert's wrist."Looking forward to that, were you?" Huger said.Robert's voice chilled. "What do you mean by that, sir?""Oliver, please," DeSaussure said. "Mr. Fallon, I fear Oliver, in his rudeness, has stumbled on your sister's fears. Forgive me, but your business difficulties are not exactly secret. Apparently she feared some, ah, temptation.""Ridiculous!" But it was close enough to his own earlier thoughts to make him angry. "And it's damned offensive!""My apologies," DeSaussure said gravely. "It was your sister's reasoning, sir, not mine."Robert acknowledged the apology with a short nod. "Is this why you wanted to see me?""Oh, no, Mr. Fallon. As you're no doubt aware, your sister divided her property roughly into two equal parts, one to be held in trust for her daughter, Charlotte Holtz, and one for Edward Fallon, her adopted son. These will be turned over at age twenty-five, unless either makes a marriage without the trustees' consent, in which case the bulk of the legacy will be divided among that legatee's children when the youngest reaches twenty-five." He paused. "The children, I fear, are the problem.""Problem?" Robert said. "They're safe in my house, taking lessons from a tutor I hired.""Exactly," Huger broke in. "Picking up your strange ideas against slavery.""Be quiet, Oliver," DeSaussure said. "I objected to the way Mrs. Holtz cut you out of her will, Mr. Fallon. Not mentioning you would be one thing, but to specifically state you were to receive nothing ..." He spread his hands. "Are you certain that won't color your attitude toward the children in time?""Of course not! I love those children."DeSaussure nodded thoughtfully. "There's nothing in the will to exclude you having the children. Though you realize it would be impossible to give you anything from the estate toward their support.""I wouldn't take it if offered," Robert said. He wanted nothing of Catherine's. Nothing but the children."I still say," Huger began, but DeSaussure cut him off."It's settled, then. And I think the children are in fine hands."If only Moira was as easy to convince, Robert thought.

He is a charter member of the Haiku Society of America, founded in 1968, and edited and published Haiku Magazine (1971-76). He has three published collections of longer poems and one of haiku, and has work appearing in magazines and anthologies worldwide. He has also taught in the National Endowment for the Arts &#34;Poets-in-the Schools&#34; program, leading writing workshops in hundreds of schools, and he regularly speaks at conferences in the U.S., Canada, and Japan. Higginson&#39;s international anthology of haiku for children, Wind in the Long Grass, is a classroom favorite. His two-volume sequel to The Haiku Handbook, The Haiku Seasons and Haiku World, gives a comprehensive view of the history, present state, and international possibilities of seasonal consciousness in poetry.[The opening pages of the first section of Chapter 5, "The Haiku Seasons."] <p>From Seasons to Saijiki </p><p>All traditional Japanese poetry has historically been deeply involved with nature. Natural cycles, such as the seasons and the course of love relationships, have long been major subject matter for composition, the primary source of figurative language, and a large part of the basis for organizing poetry collections. According to principles of Japanese poetry well-recognized by the fifteenth century, certain words and phrases embody ideas that go beyond their literal meanings. For example, using the word "blossom" (hana), without the name of a specific blossom, means the blossoms of ornamental cherry trees. For any other blossom one must specify: "peach blossoms" (momo no hana), and so on. Further, the word "cherry" (sakura) always means "cherry blossoms"--unless one specifies "fruit of the cherry" (sakura no mi). This last is the reverse of the usual English practice, where the word "cherry" normally means the fruit and to specify the blossoms one says "cherry blossoms." But in Japanese poetry the principle goes deeper. </p><p>For the Japanese many natural phenomena and human activities and the words and phrases traditionally used to name them immediately bring to mind the seasons in which they typically occur--or become most noticed--along with a whole range of temporally-related images. The effect on the Japanese reader is somewhat like that for a New Englander who reads the phrase "the frost is on the pumpkin": One not only sees the whiteness covering the orange surface of the pumpkin, but also smells the scent of cut-over fields and woodsmoke, feels the nip of frost in the air, and perhaps thinks of a drink of hot apple cider. A friend, when asked what the phrase meant to her, came up with similar images, and without being prompted associated the phrase with Thanksgiving, in late November. </p><p>Every culture has phrases, often used in literature, which bring to mind whole complexes of associated images and feelings. Ezra Pound called the use of such phrases "logopoeia," which stimulates "the associations (intellectual or emotional) that have remained in the receiver's consciousness in relation to the actual words or word groups employed" (ABC of Reading). In Japanese traditional literature those "words or word groups" associated with the seasons have been particularly appreciated, and even catalogued.</p></p><h2>Four Square Writing Method : A Unique Approach to Teaching Basic Writing Skills for Grades 1-3</h2><p>Teach writing skills using this innovative new approach that has been proven to work in classrooms just like yours.

In this vivid biography, here updated and reissued with a new preface, Frank Barlow reveals an unconventional, flamboyant William Rufus a far more attractive and interesting monarch than previously believed. Weaving an intimate account of the life of the king into the wider history of Anglo-Norman government, Barlow shows how William confirmed royal power in England, restored the ducal rights in France, and consolidated the Norman conquest. A boisterous man, William had many friends and none of the cold cruelty of most medieval monarchs. He was famous for his generosity and courage, and generally known to be homosexual. Licentious, eccentric, and outrageous, his court was attacked at the time by Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, and later by censorious historians. This highly readable account of William Rufus and his brief but important reign is an essential volume for readers with an interest in Anglo-Saxon and medieval history or in the lives of extraordinary monarchs.</p><p><b>Frank Barlow</b> is emeritus professor of history at the University of Exeter, England, and author of many major books on medieval history, including <i>Edward the Confessor</i>.</p><h2>The treasury of flowers</h2><p>Sm Quarto, pp. 118, Small Flower Book illustrations by Redoute, Sowerby, Turpin and Many Others Are Explored</p><p></p><h2>South Carolina and the American Revolution: A Battlefield History</h2><p>An estimated one-third of all combat actions in the American Revolution took place in South Carolina. From the partisan clashes of the backcountry&#39;s war for the hearts and minds of settlers to bloody encounters with Native Americans on the frontier, more battles were fought in South Carolina than any other of the original thirteen states. The state also had more than its share of pitched battles between Continental troops and British regulars. In South Carolina and the American Revolution: A Battlefield History, John W. Gordon illustrates how these encounters, fought between 1775 and 1783, were critical to winning the struggle that secured Americas independence from Great Britain.</p><p>"Gordon has provided historians and American Revolution enthusiasts with a wonderful guide to the battles fought in South Carolina. His prose is clear and concise, and his arguments are well-defined and supported."--<i>Journal of Military History</i> <p>"Gordon's treatment of the American Revolution in South Carolina succeeds on several levels. . . . For those who want the detail, it is here. For those who want to understand the context, that is also here."--<i>South Carolina Historical Magazine</i> </p><p>"Gordon's book on the war in South Carolina is a welcome addition to the literature on the American Revolution. It offers both an excellent survey of this conflict and is also a useful work of reference, its full bibliography and footnotes making it a good starting point for further research into an important and interesting episode in American history."--<i>Army Historical Research</i></p><b>John W.

It was in fact one of the most spectacularly creative episodes in the history of the world. In this book, Johnathan Israel gives the definitive account of the emergence of the United Provinces as a great power, and explains the subsequent decline in the eighteenth century. He places the thought, politics, religion, and social developments of the Golden Age in their broad context, and examines the changing relationship between the northern Netherlands and the south which was to develop into modern Belgium.<br> This comprehensive and lucid account will be as useful to the reader primarily interested in artistic and cultural history as to the student who needs a survey of the Republic's institutions, class structure, and economic development. At the same time it will provide an invaluable aid to scholars interested in new research and new interpretations.</p><p>Jonathan Israel is the author of many well-respected books in European and particularly Dutch history, amongst them Dutch Primacy in World Trade, 1585-1740 (OUP, 1989), European Jewry in the Age of Mercantilism, 1550-1750 (OUP, 1985), The Dutch Republic in the Hispanic World, 1606-1661 (OUP,<br>1982), and joint editor of From Persecution to Toleration (OUP, 1991).<br>"Jonathan Israel's 1,231-page blockbuster forms the inaugural volume of a new series, the Oxford History of Early Modern Europe, and offers a comprehensive, integrated account of the northern part of the Netherlands over almost 350 years...<em>The Dutch Republic</em> represents the fruit of 12 years of research, contemplation and writing, and brims over with interesting detail."--<em>The New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Those with a serious interest in the history of the Netherlands will not only have to read this book, they will enjoy it."--<em>Sixteenth Century Journal</em><p></p><br>"The definitive work on the Low Countries for this spectacular but complex period of history....A major contribution to the field and a superb production; the bibliography, plates, and maps alone are worth the price."--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"Isreal performs the great service of charting a path through this literature and presents a coherent and comprehensive picture of the Dutch Republic...is comprehensive in scope and yet so clearly and carefully written that it could serve as a textbook for graduate history courses.

In <i>Food Justice</i>, Robert Gottlieb and Anupama Joshi tell the story of this emerging movement.</p><p>A food justice framework ensures that the benefits and risks of how food is grown and processed, transported, distributed, and consumed are shared equitably. Gottlieb and Joshi recount the history of food injustices and describe current efforts to change the system, including community gardens and farmer training in Holyoke, Massachusetts, youth empowerment through the Rethinkers in New Orleans, farm-to-school programs across the country, and the Los Angeles school system's elimination of sugary soft drinks from its cafeterias. And they tell how food activism has succeeded at the highest level: advocates waged a grassroots campaign that convinced the Obama White House to plant a vegetable garden. The first comprehensive inquiry into this emerging movement,<i> Food Justice</i> addresses the increasing disconnect between food and culture that has resulted from our highly industrialized food system. </p></p><p>Robert Gottlieb is Emeritus Professor of Urban &amp; Environmental Policy and founder and former Director of the Urban and Environmental Policy Institute at Occidental College.

Gottlieb and Joshi pull no punches. Their point of view, that the dominant agroindustrial food system is inherently unjust to farm workers, consumers (including our children), and the communities that suffer from the external costs of food production, comes through loud and clear.</p>&#x2015;<b>Nevin Cohen</b>, Eugene Lang College, New School for Liberal Arts<br><br><p><i>Food Justice</i> is about who grows our food, how it is grown, where it is grown, who gets to eat, and the pleasure and celebration of eating food that is good food, clean food, fair food. <i>Food Justice</i> tells us that growing and eating food are political acts that challenge a system that is neither good, nor clean, nor fair.

Carlyle's investments include everything from defense contractors to telecommunications and aerospace companies. But there is more to this company than meets the eye. Carlyle's executives include heavyweights from the worlds of business and politics, such as former secretary of defense and CIA deputy director Frank Carlucci, former secretary of state James Baker III, former President George Bush, former UK Prime Minister John Major, and former chairman of the SEC Arthur Levitt. Osama Bin Laden's estranged family was personally invested in the group until recently. In The Iron Triangle, journalist Dan Briody examines a company at the nexus of big business, government, and defense that, according to some sources, epitomizes corporate cronyism, conflicts of interest, and war profiteering. This fascinating examination leads readers into a w orld that few can imagine-full of clandestine meetings, quid pro quo deals, bitter ironies, and pettyjealousies. And the cast of characters includes some of the most powerful men in the world. Strap in, because this ride could get a little bumpy.</p> <p>Dan Briody (New York, NY) is an award-winning business journalist whose Red Herring article "Carlyle's Way" broke the story on the inner workings of the Carlyle Group. Briody has appeared on numerous radio and television programs covering the Carlyle Group and has become a primary source for other journalists covering this story. Briody's articles have appeared in Forbes, Red Herring, and the Industry Standard.</p></p><p>To the outside observer, the Carlyle Group&#x2013;one of the largest private equity firms in the world&#x2013;may seem like just another company trying to maneuver its way through the complex world of finance and investing. But there is more to this organization than meets the eye. With $14 billion under management, an employee roster that reads like a who&#x2019;s who from the worlds of business and politics, and hundreds of defense, aerospace, telecom, and healthcare companies in its portfolio, the Carlyle Group operates within a powerful and profitable world known as the iron triangle&#x2013;a place where industry, government, and the military converge. <p>But, for the Carlyle Group, doing business at the murky intersection of Washington politics, national security, and private capital has come at a price. According to some, the Carlyle Group is a company that epitomizes corporate cronyism, conflicts of interest, and war profiteering&#x2013;and they may be right.</p> <p>In The Iron Triangle: Inside the Secret World of the Carlyle Group, award-winning business journalist Dan Briody closely examines the dealings of this group and explores the high-powered individuals who make up a company which is enigmatically self-described as "a vast interlocking global network." You&#x2019;ll go inside the Carlyle Group and watch how deals are made and governments swayed to accept the Carlyle way. And you&#x2019;ll learn how questions abound when you&#x2019;re playing for keeps.</p> <p>Witness how the Carlyle Group:</p> <ul> <li>Profited from the September 11th terrorist attacks and continues to profit from the ongoing war on terrorism</li> <li>Pried open the wallets of Saudi Arabia and South Korea through the whirlwind business trips of former President George Bush</li> <li>Liquidated holdings from the estranged family of Osama bin Laden only after news reports revealed the company&#x2019;s association with the family</li> <li>Went into overdrive to save the outdated Crusader howitzer which was being built by United Defense&#x2013;a Carlyle company</li> <li>Was born through the Great Eskimo Tax Scam&#x2013;a tax loophole used by cofounders Stephen Norris and David Rubenstein that has since been sewn up</li> <li>Found what would become their identity&#x2013;defense contracting&#x2013;with the help of former Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci</li> </ul> <p>Full of clandestine meetings, quid pro quo deals, bitter ironies, and petty jealousies, The Iron Triangle is a penetrating investigation that will lead you into a world that few could ever imagine.</p>"The Carlyle Group is a distressing example of the way Washington, DC works. The Iron Triangle gives you an insiders&#x2019; perspective on this &#x2018;creature&#x2019; of the Beltway." <br> &#x2013;Thomas Fitton, President, Judicial Watch, Inc. <p>from The Iron Triangle:</p> <p>Dwight D. Eisenhower, upon leaving the office of president in 1961, warned future generations against the dangers of a "military-industrial complex," and the "grave implications" of the "conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry." The wisdom of these comments has clearly been lost in the forty years since Ike left office. And the first step towards turning things around is understanding how we got here. No single company can illustrate that progression better than the Carlyle Group, a business founded on a tax scheme in 1987 that has grown up to be what its own marketing literature once called "a vast interlocking global network." The company does business at the confluence of the war on terrorism and corporate responsibility. It is a world that few of us can even imagine, full of clandestine meetings, quid pro quo deals, bitter ironies, and petty jealousies. And the cast of characters includes some of the most famous and powerful men in the world. This is today&#x2019;s America.

But her best-known achievement was the publication of Silent Spring, an account of the dangerous effects of pesticides on plants and animals.

In the popular mind, however, biblical archaeology is still alive and well.<br> In <em>Shifting Sands</em>, Thomas W. Davis charts the evolution and the demise of the discipline. Biblical archaeology, he writes, was an attempt to ground the historical witness of the Bible in demonstrable historical reality. Its theoretical base lay in the field of theology. American mainstream Protestantism strongly resisted the inroads of continental biblical criticism, and sought support for their conservative views in archaeological research on the ancient Near East. The Bible was the source of the agenda for biblical archaeology, an agenda that was ultimately apologetical.<br> Davis traces the fascinating story of the interaction of biblical studies, theology, and archaeology in Palestine, and the remarkable individuals who pioneered the discipline. He highlights the achievements of biblical archaeologists in the field, who gathered an immense body of data. By clarifying the theoretical and methodological framework of the original excavators, he believes, these data can be made more useful for current research, allowing a more sober, reasoned judgment of both the accomplishments and the failures of biblical archaeology.<br></p><p><br>Thomas W.

He has more than twenty-five years of archaeological experience, having excavated in Cyprus, Jordan, Egypt, and the United States.<br><br>Thomas Daviss <em>Shifting Sands: The Rise and Fall of Biblical Archaeology</em> could not be more timely. The long-standing question of the historicity, the truth, of the Bible; understanding the role that it has played in the now-beleaguered Western cultural tradition; seeing how archaeology is being employed today in the Middle East by all parties to create a past (or invent it) that may well shape all our futures-these are burning issues. Daviss well told story of archaeology in the region, his balanced judgments, and his cautious optimism for an honest dialogue between archaeology and biblical studies, free of theological and nationalistic biases, offer some hope at a time when skepticism prevails. --William G. Dever, Professor of Near Eastern Archaeology emeritus, University of Arizona<p></p><br>"Davis perceptively traces the history of biblical archaeology and the issues underlying its rise and demise.

Award-winning Montessori teacher Catherine McTamaney revisits the eighty-one verses of Lao-tzu&#39;s Tao Te Ching and relates them to the life and work of teachers, parents, and children. Originally meant to remind rather than direct and to show the way toward natural harmony in the world around and within us, Lao-tzu&#39;s verses find a new meaning through McTamaney&#39;s skillful mixture of spirituality and education.Take a moment to read a single stanza, then put it aside and muse upon its meaning. By revisiting one verse each day, you can relate its images to your life as a teacher, parent, or child. Whether you are familiar with the writings of Lao-tzu or are simply ready to explore a refreshingly contemplative perspective on children and teachers, The Tao of Montessori is a profound work of intellectual stimulation.</p><p>Catherine McTamaney is an award-winning Montessori teacher, former school director, and school consultant.

Albertine has moved in with Marcel in his family's apartment in Paris, where the pair have a seemingly limitless supply of money and are chaperoned only by Marcel's judgmental family servant, Franï¿½oise. Marcel, who worries obsessively about Albertine's relationships with other women, grows more and more irrational in his attempts to control her, keeping her prisoner in his apartment and buying her couture gowns, furs, and jewelry in an attempt to protect her from herself and from the outside world and. And yet in addition to being a tragedy of possessive love, <i>The Prisoner</i> is also a comedy of human folly and misunderstanding, linked to the other volumes of the larger novel through its themes of class differences, art, irrationality, social snobbery, and, of course, time and memory.</p><p><b>Marcel Proust</b> (1871-1922) was born in Auteuil, France. In his twenties, following a year in the army, he became a conspicuous society figure, frequenting the most fashionable Paris salons of the day. After 1899, however, his chronic asthma, the death of his parents, and his growing disillusionment with humanity caused him to lead an increasingly retired life. From 1907 on, he rarely emerged from his apartment on Boulevard Haussmann, where he wrote letters and devoted himself to the completion of <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>. <br><br><b>Carol Clark</b> (translator; 1940-2015) was an emeritus fellow and tutor in French at Balliol College, Oxford.

I could tell from the first street noises, whether they reached me muffled and distorted by dampness or twanging like arrows in the empty, resonant space of a wide-open morning, icy and pure. The rumbling of the first tram told me whether it was huddled against the rain or forging gaily toward a blue horizon. And maybe even those sounds had been preceded by some swifter, more penetrating emanation which had slid into my sleep and suffused it with a sadness foretelling snow, or had found there a certain little intermittent figure which it set to singing so many rousing hymns in praise of the sun that, though still asleep, I would begin to smile, my closed eyes preparing to be dazzled, until a crash of music finally brought me awake. It was, in fact, mainly from my bedroom that I perceived the world around me at this period. I know Bloch spread the story that when he came to see me in the evening, he would hear the sound of conversation; since my mother was at Combray and he never found anyone in my room, he concluded that I was talking to myself. When, much later, he found out that Albertine had been living with me then and realized that I had been hiding her from everyone, he declared that he understood at last why, at that time in my life, I never wanted to go out. He was wrong. Very understandably so, since reality, even if it is inevitable, is not completely predictable; those who learn some correct detail about the life of another promptly jump from it to quite incorrect conclusions and see in the newly discovered fact the explanation for things which in truth are completely unrelated to it.</p><p>When I think now of how my friend had left Balbec with me and come back to Paris to live under the same roof, giving up her idea of going on a cruise; of how she slept twenty paces from my bedroom, at the end of the corridor, in my father's little room with the tapestries, and how every evening, very late, before leaving me to sleep, she would slip her tongue into my mouth like my daily bread, like a nourishing food having the almost sacred character of all flesh on which suffering&#x2014;the suffering that we have endured for its sake&#x2014;has conferred a kind of spiritual sweetness, then the analogy which springs to my mind is not the night which Captain de Borodino allowed me to spend at the barracks-a favor which, after all, cured a mere passing malaise&#x2014;but that other night when my father sent Mama to sleep in the little bed next to mine. So true is it that life, if it decides once more to spare us a trial which seems inevitable, does so in a different manner&#x2014;such a contradictory manner, sometimes, that it appears almost sacrilegious to recognize that the grace granted to us is the same!</p><p>Once Albertine had learned from Franï¿½oise that, in the darkness of my room with its still-closed curtains, I was not sleeping, she did not bother to avoid making a small amount of noise as she washed in her bathroom. So then I would often go into another bathroom adjoining hers, which was a pleasant place. In former times a theatrical producer would spend hundreds of thousands of francs to stud with real emeralds the throne from which the diva would play the part of an empress. The Russian Ballet has taught us that simple, well-directed lighting effects can flood the stage with jewels just as sumptuous and more varied. This new dï¿½cor, already more immaterial, is still not so charming as the one which the eight o'clock sun produces in place of what we were accustomed to see when we did not rise until midday. The windows of our two bathrooms were not clear but, so that we could not be seen from outside, were all puckered into an old-fashioned, artificial frost effect. The sun suddenly turned this net of glass to yellow, gilded it and, gently uncovering in me a young man of former times who had been long hidden by habit, intoxicated me with memories, as if I had been in the open air looking at gilded foliage in which not even the presence of a bird was wanting. For I could hear Albertine endlessly whistling:</p><p>Sorrows are crazy<br>And listening to them is crazier still.</p><p>I was too fond of her not to smile happily at her bad musical taste. Mme Bontemps, I may say, had had a passion for that song the previous summer, until she heard that it was a silly thing, whereupon, instead of asking Albertine to sing it when people called, she began to ask for:</p><p>A farewell song rises from troubled springs</p><p>which in turn became "that old thing of Massenet's that the child is always trotting out." A cloud would pass, hiding the sun, and I would see the modest foliage of the glass curtain turn dull and lapse into a grisaille.</p><p>Albertine's bathroom was just like mine but, since there was another at the other end of the apartment, Mama had never used this one for fear of disturbing me with noise. The walls separating the two were so thin that we could chat to each other as we washed, carrying on a conversation interrupted only by the sound of the water, in the kind of intimacy which is often produced in hotels by the cramped space and nearness of the rooms, but which in Paris is so rare. At other times, I stayed in bed, dreaming for as long as I liked, for the orders were never to come into my room until I had rung. Because of the inconvenient way in which the bell-push had been hung over my bed, reaching it took so long that sometimes, tiring of the effort to grasp it and enjoying being alone, I almost went back to sleep. Not that I was completely indifferent to Albertine's presence in the family apartment. By separating her from her friends I had succeeded in sparing my heart further suffering. I had placed it in a position of rest, of near immobility which would help it to heal. But the state of calm which my friend's presence produced in me was an alleviation of suffering rather than actual joy. Not that it did not allow me to enjoy many pleasures from which my previous, acute pain had closed me off, but far from owing these pleasures to Albertine, whom I hardly even found pretty any more, in whose company I was bored and whom I had a clear sense of no longer loving, I experienced them, on the contrary, when she was not with me. So I would begin the morning by not having her called at once, especially if the weather were fine. For a few moments, knowing that his company made me happier than hers, I remained in private colloquy with the little inner figure, singer of salutations to the sun, whom I mentioned a moment ago. Of all the persons who make up our individual selves, the most apparent are not the most essential. When illness has eliminated them one by one, there will survive in me a final two or three, the hardest to kill off, and notably one, a philosopher who is happy only when he has discovered, between two works of art or between two sensations, a common factor. But I have sometimes wondered if the last of all will not be the little man very like another little man that the Combray optician kept in his shop window, who took his hood off whenever the sun shone and put it back on again if it was going to rain. I know that little man, with all his egoism; I can be suffering an asthma attack which only the coming of rain would relieve, he does not care and, at the first drops that I have been so longing for, he scowls and crossly pulls up his hood. On the other hand, I feel sure that on my deathbed, when all my other "I's" are already gone, if there is a blink of sun, while I am drawing my last breaths, the little barometer man will be delighted and will take his hood off and sing, "Ah! The sun at last!"</p><p>I rang for Franï¿½oise. I opened the <i>Figaro</i>. I looked for, and once more did not find, an article or something calling itself an article which I had sent to that newspaper and which was nothing but a slightly rearranged version of the recently rediscovered page which I had written in Dr. Percepied's carriage while looking at the steeples of Martinville. Then I read Mama's latest letter. She found it strange, shocking, that an unmarried girl should be living alone with me. It may be that on the first day, when we were leaving Balbec, when she saw me looking so unhappy and was worried about leaving me alone, she had been pleased to hear that Albertine was coming with us and to see loaded on to the train, next to our luggage (the luggage I had spent the night weeping over in the hotel in Balbec), Albertine's narrow black boxes, which had seemed to me to have the shape of coffins, so that I did not know whether they would bring life into our house, or death. But I did not even think about Mama's feelings, being entirely caught up in the joy of that radiant morning and the thought that, after all my fear of staying in Balbec, I was taking Albertine home with me. Mama may not have been hostile to the scheme at first (she spoke kindly to my friend, as a mother does whose son has been seriously wounded and who is grateful to the young mistress who is devotedly nursing him), but she became so as it was too thoroughly carried out, and as the young woman's stay in our house&#x2014;in our house in the absence of my parents&#x2014;became prolonged. I cannot say, however, that she ever made her hostility plain to me. Just as before, when she felt she could no longer reproach me with my nervous disposition, my laziness, now she was afraid&#x2014;something I perhaps did not entirely understand at the time or did not wish to understand&#x2014;that by expressing any reservations about the girl to whom I said I was going to become engaged, she might cast a shadow over my future life, make me less committed to my wife, perhaps lead me to reproach myself, once she was gone, for having hurt her by marrying Albertine. Mama preferred to seem to endorse a choice that she felt she would not be able to make me reconsider. But everyone who saw her at that time told me that her sorrow at having lost her own mother was aggravated by a look of perpetual worry. This mental strain, this constant argument with herself, made Mama's temples over-heat, and she was constantly opening windows to try to cool down. But she could not take a decision for fear of "influencing" me in the wrong direction and spoiling what she thought was my happiness. She could not even make up her mind to stop me having Albertine in the apartment in the meantime. She did not want to appear more strict than Mme Bontemps, whose place it was, if anyone's, to act, and who did not find the arrangement unsuitable, much to my mother's surprise. In any case she was sorry to have been obliged to leave the two of us together by having to set off just then for Combray, where she saw she might have to stay (and did indeed stay) for many months, during which time my great-aunt needed her by her day and night. Everything there was made easy for her by the kindness, the devotion of Legrandin, for whom nothing was too much trouble, who put off from week to week his return to Paris, simply because my aunt, whom he did not know particularly well, had been a friend of his mother's, and because he realized that the dying woman valued his attentions and could not do without him. Snobbery is a serious malady of the soul, but a localized one which does not affect it overall. I, on the other hand, was delighted by Mama's absence in Combray, for it meant that Albertine (whom I could not ask to conceal it) would not be able to mention to her her friendship with Mlle Vinteuil. This relationship would, in my mother's eyes, have utterly precluded not only a marriage, which she had in any case asked me not to discuss in too definite terms with my friend and which furthermore was coming to seem intolerable to me, but even a stay in our house by Albertine as a guest. Failing such a serious reason, of which she was not aware, Mama, under the double effect of her mother's edifying and liberating example on the one hand (Grandmother, that admirer of George Sand, who defined virtue as nobility of heart) and on the other my own corrupting influence, now showed tolerance for women of whose conduct she would once have been severely critical and whom she would have condemned even now if they had been middle-class friends of hers from Paris or Combray, but whose great souls I praised to her and whom she forgave much because they were fond of me. In spite of everything, and even setting aside the question of propriety, I think Albertine would have exhausted Mama's patience, for Mama had learned at Combray, from Aunt L onie and from all her female relations, habits of order of which my friend had not the slightest inkling. She would no more have closed a door nor, on the other hand, hesitated to enter a room where the door was open than would a dog or a cat. Her somewhat inconvenient charm consisted in being in the house not in the manner of a young girl but of a domestic animal which comes into a room, goes out, turns up in the place you least expect it, jumps on to the bed-I found this deeply restful-lies down beside one, makes a place for itself and lies there without moving, without annoying one as a person would. However, she finally adapted herself to my sleeping hours and learned, not just not to try to come into my room, but even not to make any noise until I rang. It was Fran oise who set these rules for her. Franï¿½oise was one of those Combray servants who know their master's importance, and that the least they can do is to make everyone show him the respect they think is his due. When a visitor from outside gave&nbsp;Franï¿½oise a tip to be shared with the kitchen-maid, the donor hardly had time to hand over his coin before Franï¿½oise, with equal speed, discretion and energy, had primed the girl to appear and thank him, not under her breath but loudly and clearly, as&nbsp;Franï¿½oise&nbsp;had told her was the right way to do. The curï¿½ of Combray was not a genius, but he too knew how things should be done. Under his instruction, the daughter of some Protestant cousins of Mme Sazerat's had been converted to Catholicism, and the family had shown him all due appreciation. There was a question of her marrying a nobleman from Mï¿½sï¿½glise. The young man's parents wrote asking for information about her, a rather disdainful letter in which they showed contempt for her Protestant birth. The priest replied in such terms that the nobleman had to swallow his pride and write a very different letter, begging as the most precious favor to be allowed to form an alliance with the young lady.</p></p><h2>Experiencing the Lifespan</h2><p>Winner of the Textbook Excellence Award from the Text and Academic Authors Association, Janet Belsky&#x2019;s <i>Experiencing the Lifespan</i> always reflects a scientist&#x2019;s understanding of key research, a psychologist&#x2019;s understanding of people, and a teacher&#x2019;s understanding of students.

Foreword by James Michener.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: PolishThe Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth still controlled eastern Europe in 1647, but during that year everything changed. The first sparks appeared in the Ukraine, where a domestic dispute between Bohdan Hmyelnitzki and his neighbor mushroomed into a full-blown Cossack rebellion against the gentry. Long-smoldering resentments flashed into a wildfire of rape, pillage, and murder as the peasants joined the Cossack army and fought their way toward Warsaw, bringing with them the dreaded hordes of Tartars from the east. Fighting in this epic conflict, Yan Skshetuski, commander of armored knights in the prince's army, falls in love with the beautiful Helen, only to have her stolen by the Cossacks. Thus, the string of ensuing battles becomes not just a struggle for Poland's survival but a search by Skshetuski and his fellow knights for Helen, the symbol of all Poland was and now stands to lose. With Fire and Sword , the first installment of Sienkiewicz's "Trilogy," will take its place beside such works as the Iliad as one of the great pieces of epic literature. The Polish author, winner of the 1905 Nobel Prize for Literature, captures the historical essence of a culture in eclipse, expressing it through characters at once larger than life and engagingly human. While his Quo Vadis? is widely known, until now the "Trilogy" has been virtually unread outside Poland because it lacked a readable translation and was suppressed by Poland's Communist government. However, Kuniczak's magnificent rendition now offers this literary gem to a wide audience. As the next two volumes appear, the applause will surely grow. Most highly recommended.<br><i>- Paul E.

Chronologically arranged, the essays demonstrate the abundance, diversity, and main conceptual trends in recent feminist scholarship.</p><p>Norma BroudeThis collection of 28 essays is an abundant and diverse exploration of feminist art history from the Renaissance to the present. Deft, intuitive writers equipped with the intellectual equivalent of a surgeon's scalpel cut into the established canon to expose how sexual bias has distorted Western art history. In the introductory text, the editors warn that the "postmodern position that no qualitative standards in art are legitimate" can be construed as a device to exclude those who are not white male artists from an "expanding and changing canon." Essays like Patricia Simons's "Women in Frames" methodically reveal depictions of the female body as subservient to the (male) viewer's gaze, the function of which is control and supervision. As a whole, this book is a thoughtful, stimulating collection that addresses the mechanism inherent in art that works to block women's emotional, social, and political self-realization.

Autopsy, crime scene, hagiography, hymn? The chronicle of an obsessive love.</b></p><p>In the middle of the night between the 25th and 26th of November, Vincent fell from the third floor playing parachute with a bathrobe. He drank a liter of tequila, smoked Congolese grass, snorted cocaine...<br>&#x2015;from <i>Crazy for Vincent</i></p><p><i>Crazy for Vincent</i> begins with the death of the figure it fixates upon: Vincent, a skateboarding, drug-addled, delicate &#x201c;monster&#x201d; of a boy in whom the narrator finds a most sublime beauty. By turns tender and violent, Vincent drops in and out of French writer and photographer Hervï¿½ Guibert's life over the span of six years (from 1982, when he first met Vincent as a fifteen-year-old teenager, to 1988). After Vincent's senseless death, the narrator embarks on a reconnaissance writing mission to retrieve the Vincent that had entered, elevated, and emotionally eviscerated his life, working chronologically backward from the death that opens the text. Assembling Vincent's fragmentary appearances in his journal, the author seeks to understand what Vincent's presence in his life had been: a passion? a love? an erotic obsession? or an authorial invention? A parallel inquiry could be made into the book that results: Is it diary, memoir, poem, fiction? Autopsy, crime scene, hagiography, hymn? <i>Crazy for Vincent</i> is a text the very nature of which is as untethered as desire itself.</p></p><p>Hervï¿½ Guibert (1955&#x2013;1991) was a writer, a photography critic for <i>Le Monde</i>, a photographer, and filmmaker.

Whether examining the corruption at the heart of modern politics, the "Rambification" of popular entertainment, or the collapse of our school systems, Morris Berman suspects that there is little we can do as a society to arrest the onset of corporate Mass Mind culture. Citing writers as diverse as de Toqueville and DeLillo, he cogently argues that cultural preservation is a matter of individual conscience, and discusses how classical learning might triumph over political correctness with the rise of a "a new monastic individual"&#x2015;a person who, much like the medieval monk, is willing to retreat from conventional society in order to preserve its literary and historical treasures. "Brilliantly observant, deeply thoughtful ....lucidly argued."&#x2015;<em>Christian Science Monitor</em></p><p><i>"If you have finally had it with CNN and Hollywood and John Grisham and New Age 'spirituality,' then pull up a chair, unplug your phone (beeper, TV, fax machine, computer, etc.), and give me a few hours of your time. I promise to do my best not to entertain you."</i><p> A slightly forbidding introduction to a book, but indicative of its author's disgust at the homogenized McWorld in which we live, and an enticing challenge to read on. As the title <i>The Twilight of American Culture</i> suggests, Morris Berman's outlook is somewhat bleak. Analogizing the contemporary United States to the late Roman Empire, Berman sees a nation fat on useless consumption, saturated with corporate ideology, and politically, psychically, and culturally dulled. But he believes that this behemoth--what Thomas Frank called the "multinational entertainment oligopoly"--must buckle under its own weight. His hope for a brighter tomorrow lies in a modern monastic movement, in which keepers of the enlightenment flame resist the constant barrage of "spin and hype." Ironically, despite his disdain for "the fashionable patois of postmodernism," he approvingly quotes poststructuralist theorist Jean-Franï¿½ois Lyotard's maxim "elitism for everybody" in describing this cadre of idiosyncratic, literate devotees, these new monks.</p><p> Berman is plainspoken and occasionally caustic. <i>The Twilight of American Culture</i> is an informed and thought-provoking book, a wake-up call to a nation whose powerful minority has become increasingly self-satisfied as their stock options ripen, while an underclass that vastly outnumbers the e-generation withers on the vine and cannot locate itself on any map. It is a quick and savage read that aims to get your eyes off this computer, your nose out of that self-help book, and send you back to thought and action. <i>--J.R.</i></p>Morris Berman is a cultural historian and the author of The Twilight of American Culture.

Tracing Dewey&#39;s life and influences that shaped it, &#34;Irrepressible Reformer&#34; explores Dewey&#39;s ingenious enterprise as a library innovator, New York State education official, and business and resort operator - as well as those aspects many found arrogant, manipulative, immoral and bigoted. The library world&#39;s most famous figure, Dewey (1851-1931) copyrighted his Decimal Classification System in 1876 as a young man at Amherst College. After many editions, it is used today in more than 100,000 libraries worldwide. Organiser and first executive officer of the American Library Association, he is credited as the father of library education and of librarianship as a profession. In his myriad activities in education, spelling and metric reform, state politics and hostelry, Dewey crossed paths with Andrew Carnegie, Teddy Roosevelt, Booker T. Washington, and other giants of his era. As New York State Regents Secretary, Dewey was a turn-of-the-century educational reformer ahead of his time in certification and extended learning. Wiegand gives a full account of this period, which ended in a public dipsute over Dewey&#39;s exclusionary treatment of Jews. &#34;Irrepressible Reformer&#34; explores Dewey&#39;s further troubles with anti-Semitism and sexual harassment as he built the Lake Placid Club in New York into a $15 million property. &#34;Irrepressible Reformer&#34; suffers none of the restraints of previous &#34;kinder, gentler&#34; biographical treatments, as it reveals the enigmatic Dewey &#34;warts and all&#34;. Yet, the prize-winning author provides richer background on Dewey&#39;s positive achievements than any work to date. A profound character study that reads like a novel, &#34;Irrepressible Reformer&#34; should long serve students and researchers in librarianship, education, New York State history and American reform movements.</p><p>Melvil Dewey (1851-1931) is known for his Decimal Classification system for libraries, but the system was only one endeavor in a feverishly ambitious life. The other Dewey - reformer, businessman, powerful state education officer, resort-empire builder - has long been obscured, as has the dark side of Dewey&#39;s personality. Drawing from years of archival research, preeminent Melvil Dewey historian Wayne A. Wiegand has produced the first frank and comprehensive biography of this enigmatic reformer. While providing richer background on Dewey&#39;s positive achievements than earlier, reverential biographies, Wiegand reveals his subject as one who was &#34;driven, tense, often arrogant&#34;, who had &#34;an obsessive need to control...and self-righteously denied his own racism and class prejudices&#34;. Whatever Dewey&#39;s virtues and flaws, his influence on libraries and education was profound. To understand his life is to better understand these institutions - then and now - and the people who shape them.Finally, Melvil Dewey fully revealed, in entertaining prose, built on rigorous and deep historical scholarship. This is the definitive biography we've missed for so long. It tells the story of an American archetype?a man imbued with the inventive curiosity, sexism, anti-Semitism, racism, type-A control-freakishness, and reform zeal so characteristic of the power brokers of his time and his nation. The result is a masterpiece of history. It appropriately bears the imprint of the library association he founded and nurtured and which was enlisted for years to coconspire to cover up the darker side of the old boy. Wiegand's (a Dewey historian) penetrating, provocative interpretations add to the readability and pleasure of this fine biography, even his highly arguable view that the persistence of Dewey's design for librarianship means it "will likely remain a marginal profession." To this member of the small club of holders of jobs Dewey once held, it is obvious that Wiegand's work can be used to make the opposite case as well: that it was Dewey who gave librarianship any hope at all of becoming central to modern American society. Either way, you should own and read this brilliant, comprehensive study of the biased crackpot genius to whom we librarians owe so much.?John Berry, "Library Journal"<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Filipino Martial Arts as Taught by Dan Inosanto</h2><p>Combat is as old as man himself. In the Philippines it developed to a degree of effectiveness unsurpassed anywhere in the world. The Filipino martial arts is an expression of man&#39;s indomitable will to survive adversity in the most direct and self-reliant manner possible. There has been an obvious need for a book that coordinates and puts into perspective the roots and principals of a fighting art--a book that explains the relationships between weapons and empty hands, philosophy and history, asseses strengths and weaknesses, and finally a book that liberates the mind from the classical way of thinking. Here now is that book. Compilation of THE FILIPINO MARTIAL ARTS has been a monumental task for the authors, representing over 1900 years of historical research, travel, observation and personal participation. Documentation of these arts have been supplemented with interviews with some of the last surviving Masters. Their daring exploits serve to illustrate the most deadly fighting systems that the world has known. This volume is illustrated with over 750 photographs and drawings and written by one of the most respected martial artists in the world.</p><p></p><h2>How to Talk Minnesotan: A Visitor&#39;s Guide</h2><p>Based in part on material written for &#34;A Prairie Home Companion,&#34; How to Talk Minnesotan will help visitors to Minnesota keep from sticking out like sore thumbs when they don&#39;t know the difference between &#34;not too bad a deal&#34; and &#34;a heckuva deal.&#34; Illustrated with line drawings.</p><p>Coming soon...Those looking for someone to fill Garrison Keillor's trademark red socks will not be appeased by Mohr, who was a writer for A Prairie Home Companion. There is a similarity in the book's wryness to the humor in the show, and there are dummied-up ads of local businesses. But despite the book's subtitle, this isn't really about Minnesota: some of the humor is based on the idiosyncracies and colloquialisms of the region, but most of it can be applied to just about any state. Still, Mohr has found some purely Minnesotan motifs: the section on starting the car in winter will ring true to anyone who has survived the experience; his few, well-chosen words on going to the lake or the cabin is acutely observed; and his attitude about lutefisk, a dish that natives consume more out of a sense of duty than with relish, strikes just the right tone (he regrets having to mention it altogether). But he misses and skims over some genuine regionalisms (where's uffda?), invents others, and usually strains to make a point. Because his humorous account of Minnesota invites comparison with Keillor, the book is found wanting. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Heads: A Biography of Psychedelic America</h2><p><i>Heads: A Biography of Psychedelic America</i> uncovers a hidden history of the biggest psychedelic distribution and belief system the world has ever known.

One of his major SF works is the Change War series, about rival time-traveling armies locked in a bitter, age-old war for control of existence; the battles frequently alter the course of human history. The most important work of Leiber's Change War series is the Hugo Award-winning novel <i>The Big Time</i>, in which doctors, entertainers, and wounded soldiers find themselves treacherously trapped with an activated atomic bomb inside the Place, a room existing outside of space-time. It's not one of Leiber's strongest novels: the cutesy-girlish narrative voice is unconvincing, while the demands of describing time travel and time paradoxes inevitably strain the prose. But <i>The Big Time</i> is a tense, claustrophobic SF mystery, and possibly the ultimate locked-room whodunit.<p> In addition to the Hugo, Nebula, Derleth, Lovecraft, and World Fantasy Awards, Fritz Leiber received the Grand Master of Fantasy (Gandalf) Award, the Life Achievement Lovecraft Award, and the Grand Master Nebula Award. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p><p><b>Fritz Leiber,</b> who died in 1992, was one of the most important SF and fantasy writers of the century. <i>The Big Time</i> is his most famous SF novel.

McCoy uncovers the deep, disturbing roots of recent scandals at Abu Ghraib and Guantï¿½namo. Far from aberrations, as the White House has claimed, <i>A Question of Torture</i> shows that these abuses are the product of a long-standing covert program of interrogation.<br> Developed at the cost of billions of dollars, the CIA's method combined "sensory deprivation" and "self-inflicted pain" to create a revolutionary psychological approach--the first innovation in torture in centuries. The simple techniques--involving isolation, hooding, hours of standing, extremes of hot and cold, and manipulation of time--constitute an all-out assault on the victim's senses, destroying the basis of personal identity. McCoy follows the years of research--which, he reveals, compromised universities and the U.S. Army--and the method's dissemination, from Vietnam through Iran to Central America. He traces how after 9/11 torture became Washington's weapon of choice in both the CIA's global prisons and in "torture-friendly" countries to which detainees are dispatched. Finally McCoy argues that information extracted by coercion is worthless, making a case for the legal approach favored by the FBI.<br> Scrupulously documented and grippingly told, <i>A Question of Torture</i> is a devastating indictment of inhumane practices that have spread throughout the intelligence system, damaging American's laws, military, and international standing.<br><br></p><p>Alfred W. McCoy is a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He is the author of numerous books and articles, including <i>The Politics <br>of Heroin in Southeast Asia</i> and <i>Closer Than Brothers</i>.<br><br>Chapter One&nbsp;Two Thousand Years of Torture<br>&nbsp;<br>In April 2004, the American public was stunned when CBS Television broadcast photographs from Abu Ghraib prison, showing Iraqis naked, hooded, and contorted in humiliating positions while U.S. soldiers stood over them, smiling.1 As the scandal grabbed headlines around the globe, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld assured Congress that the abuse was &#x201c;perpetrated by a small number of U.S. military,&#x201d; whom columnist William Safire branded as &#x201c;creeps.&#x201d;2 Other commentators&#x2014;citing the famous Stanford prison experiment in which ordinary students role-playing the &#x201c;guards&#x201d; soon became brutal&#x2014;attributed the abuse to a collapse of discipline by overstretched American soldiers in overcrowded prisons.3<br>&nbsp;<br>But these photos are not, in fact, snapshots of simple sadism or a breakdown in military discipline. Rather, they show CIA torture methods that have metastasized like an undetected cancer inside the U.S. intelligence community over the past half century. If we look closely at these grainy images, we can see the genealogy of CIA torture techniques, from their origins in 1950 to their present-day perfection. Indeed, the photographs from Iraq illustrate standard interrogation practice inside the global gulag of secret CIA prisons that have operated, on executive authority, since the start of the war on terror. These photos, and the later investigations they prompted, offer telltale signs that the CIA was both the lead agency at Abu Ghraib and the source of systematic tortures practiced in Guantï¿½namo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. In this light, the nine soldiers court-martialed for the abuse at Abu Ghraib were simply following orders. Responsibility for their actions lies higher, much higher, up the chain of command.<br>&nbsp;<br>In this heated controversy, all of us, proponents and opponents of torture alike, have been acting out a script written over fifty years ago during the depths of the Cold War. Indeed, a search for the roots of Abu Ghraib in the development and propagation of a distinctive American form of torture will, in some way, implicate almost all of our society&#x2014;the brilliant scholars who did the psychological research, the distinguished professors who advocated its use, the great universities that hosted them, the august legislators who voted funds, and the good Americans who acquiesced, by their silence, whenever media or congressional critics risked their careers for exposï¿½s that found little citizen support, allowing the process to continue.<br>&nbsp;<br>What began as an isolated incident of abuse by a few &#x201c;bad apples,&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x201c;sadistic&#x201d; soldiers on the &#x201c;night shift,&#x201d; or some &#x201c;recycled hillbillies from Cumberland, Maryland&#x201d; would grow, in just six months, into a great political scandal that diminished the majesty of the American state, the world&#x2019;s preeminent power. As the U.S. press probed and Washington&#x2019;s bureaucracy hemorrhaged documents, revelations of abuse spread from Abu Ghraib to American military prisons worldwide. Despite eleven military investigations, twelve congressional hearings, and forty White House briefings all designed to bury the scandal, responsibility climbed, by degrees, from the handful of prison guards to the Pentagon and, ultimately, the president.4 What started as an examination of the night shift in one cell block ramified into an inquiry, first into the Bush administration&#x2019;s interrogation policy, and then into the inner workings of the national-security state, the constitutional restraints on executive powers, and the limits of civil liberties&#x2014;making other recent American political scandals appear, if not petty or parochial, at least somewhat more limited in their implications. Compared to weighty matters of state raised by Abu Ghraib, Watergate, narrowly construed, seems little more than the failure of one man&#x2019;s character; Iran-Contra an isolated albeit intriguing incident at the sunset of the Cold War; and, above all, l&#x2019;affaire Monica Lewinsky sad, sordid, and forgettably partisan. At last, at the dawn of the twenty-first century, America&#x2019;s century, the United States had a crisis worthy of its grandeur as a global power, one revealing of the most profound ambiguities of our age&#x2014;the tensions between security and freedom, morality and expediency, sovereignty and internationalism, the rule of law and the imperatives of covert operations, democracy at home and dominion abroad. Yet, ironically, the gravity of the scandal has discouraged television coverage, defied close analysis, and may ultimately drive Abu Ghraib from America&#x2019;s collective memory.<br>&nbsp;<br>More deeply, this controversy is the product of a contradictory U.S. policy toward torture evident since the start of the Cold War. At the UN and other international forums, Washington opposed torture and advocated a universal standard for human rights. But, in contravention of these diplomatic conventions, the CIA propagated torture during those same decades. Several scholarly essays have noted this conflict in U.S. human rights policy without understanding the reason: notably, the persistence of torture techniques and the prerogative of their use within the intelligence community.5<br>&nbsp;<br>At the deepest level, the abuse at Abu Ghraib, Guantï¿½namo, and Kabul are manifestations of a long history of a distinctive U.S. covert-warfare doctrine developed since World War II, in which psychological torture has emerged as a central if clandestine facet of American foreign policy. Thus, this book does not focus primarily on particular incidents, even important ones such as the events at Abu Ghraib, but instead examines these events as expressions of how American power has been brought to bear upon the world&#x2014;so strong, so forceful, and so misapplied.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>From 1950 to 1962, the CIA became involved in torture through a massive mind-control effort, with psychological warfare and secret research into human consciousness that reached a cost of a billion dollars annually&#x2014;a veritable Manhattan Project of the mind.6 After experiments with hallucinogenic drugs, electric shock, and sensory deprivation, this work then produced a new approach to torture that was psychological, not physical, perhaps best described as &#x201c;no-touch torture.&#x201d; The agency&#x2019;s discovery was a counterintuitive breakthrough&#x2014; indeed, the first real revolution in the cruel science of pain in more than three centuries. To test and then propagate its distinctive form of torture, the CIA operated covertly within its own society, penetrating and compromising key American institutions&#x2014;universities, hospitals, U.S. Agency for International Development, and the armed forces. As the lead agency within the larger intelligence community, the CIA has long been able to draw upon both military and civil resources to amplify its reach and reduce its responsibility. Moreover, the agency&#x2019;s attempts to conceal these programs from executive and legislative review have required manipulation of its own government through clandestine techniques, notably disinformation and destruction of incriminating documents.<br>&nbsp;<br>Still, if genius is the discovery of the obvious, then the CIA&#x2019;s perfection of psychological torture was a major scientific turning point, albeit unnoticed and unheralded in the world beyond its secret safe houses. For more than two thousand years, interrogators had found that mere physical pain, no matter how extreme, often produced heightened resistance. By contrast, the CIA&#x2019;s psychological paradigm fused two new methods, &#x201c;sensory disorientation&#x201d; and &#x201c;self-inflicted pain,&#x201d; whose combination causes victims to feel responsible for their suffering and thus capitulate more readily to their torturers. Although seemingly benign, the term &#x201c;sensory disorientation&#x201d; means, in this CIA usage, something far more invasive. Through relentless probing into the essential nature of the human organism to identify its physiological and psychological vulnerabilities, the CIA&#x2019;s &#x201c;sensory deprivation&#x201d; has evolved into a total assault on all senses and sensibilities&#x2014;auditory, visual, tactile, temporal, temperature, survival, sexual, and cultural. Refined through years of practice, the method relies on simple, even banal procedures&#x2014;isolation, standing, heat and cold, light and dark, noise and silence&#x2014;for a systematic attack on all human senses. The fusion of these two techniques, sensory disorientation and self-inflicted pain, creates a synergy of physical and psychological trauma whose sum is a hammer-blow to the fundamentals of personal identity. <br>&nbsp;<br>That notorious photo of a hooded Iraqi on a box, arms extended and wires to his hands, exposes this covert method. The hood is for sensory deprivation, and the arms are extended for self-inflicted pain. A week after the scandal broke, the U.S. prison chief in Iraq summarized this two-phase torture. &#x201c;We will no longer, in any circumstances, hood any of the detainees,&#x201d; the general said. &#x201c;We will no longer use stress positions in any of our interrogations.&#x201d;7<br>&nbsp;<br>Although seemingly less brutal than physical methods, no-touch torture leaves deep psychological scars on both victims and interrogators. One British journalist who observed this method&#x2019;s use in Northern Ireland called sensory deprivation &#x201c;the worst form of torture&#x201d; because it &#x201c;provokes more anxiety among the interrogatees than more traditional tortures, leaves no visible scars and, therefore, is harder to prove, and produces longer lasting effects.&#x201d;8 Victims often need extensive treatment to recover from injury far more crippling than mere physical pain.9 Perpetrators can suffer a dangerous expansion of ego, leading to escalating cruelty and lasting emotional disorders. Though any ordinary man or woman can be trained to torture, every gulag has a few masters who take to the task with sadistic flair&#x2014;abhorred by their victims and valued by their superiors. Applied under the pressure of actual field operations after 1963, psychological methods soon gave way to unimaginable cruelties, physical and sexual, by individual perpetrators whose improvisations, plumbing the human capacity for brutality, are often horrifying.<br>&nbsp;<br>Why, one might ask, is psychological torture so devastating, inflicting harm that is often more lasting than even the most brutal form of physical abuse? Insights from the treatment of Chilean victims tortured under General Augusto Pinochet&#x2019;s regime offer a point of entry into this complex question. Psychotherapist Otto Doerr-Zegers found that victims suffer &#x201c;a mistrust bordering on paranoia, and a loss of interest that greatly surpasses anything observed in anxiety disorders.&#x201d; The subject &#x201c;does not only react to torture with a tiredness of days, weeks, or months, but remains a tired human being, relatively uninterested and unable to concentrate.&#x201d;10 These findings led him to a revealing question: &#x201c;What in torture makes possible a change of such nature that it appears similar to psychotic processes and to disorders of organic origin?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The answer, Doerr-Zegers argues, lies in the psychological, not physical, &#x201c;phenomenology of the torture situation&#x201d;: (1) an asymmetry of power; (2) the anonymity of the torturer to the victim; (3) the &#x201c;double bind&#x201d; of either enduring or betraying others; (4) the systematic &#x201c;falsehood&#x201d; of trumped-up charges, artificial lighting, cunning deceptions, and &#x201c;mock executions&#x201d;; (5) confinement in distinctive spaces signifying &#x201c;displacement, trapping, narrowness and destruction&#x201d;; and (6) a temporality &#x201c;characterized by some unpredictability and much circularity, having no end.&#x201d; Thus, much of the pain from all forms of torture is psychological, not physical, based upon denying victims any power over their lives. In sum, the torturer strives &#x201c;through insult and disqualification, by means of threats . . . to break all the victim&#x2019;s possible existential platforms.&#x201d; Through this asymmetry, the torturer eventually achieves &#x201c;complete power&#x201d; and reduces the victim to &#x201c;a condition of total or near total defenselessness.&#x201d;11<br>&nbsp;<br>As Doerr-Zegers describes it, the psychological component of torture becomes a kind of total theater, a constructed unreality of lies and inversion, in a plot that ends inexorably with the victim&#x2019;s self-betrayal and destruction. To make their artifice of false charges, fabricated news, and mock executions convincing, interrogators often become inspired thespians. The torture chamber itself thus has the theatricality of a set with special lighting, sound effects, props, and backdrop, all designed with a perverse stagecraft to evoke an aura of fear. Both stage and cell construct their own kind of temporality. While the play both expands and collapses time to carry the audience forward toward denouement, the prison distorts time to disorientate and then entrap the victim. As the torturer manipulates circumstances to &#x201c;maximize confusion,&#x201d; the victim feels &#x201c;prior schemas of the self and the world . . . shattered&#x201d; and becomes receptive to the &#x201c;torturer&#x2019;s construction of reality.&#x201d; Under the peculiar conditions of psychological torture, victims, isolated from others, form &#x201c;emotional ties to their tormentors&#x201d; that make them responsive to a perverse play in which they are both audience and actor, subject and object&#x2014;in a script that often leaves them not just disoriented but emotionally and psychologically damaged, in some cases for the rest of their lives.12<br>&nbsp;<br>Once the CIA completed its research into no-touch torture, application of the method was codified in the curiously named Kubark Counterintelligence Interrogation manual in 1963. The agency then set about disseminating the new practices worldwide, first through U.S. AID&#x2019;s Office of Public Safety to police departments in Asia and Latin America and later, after 1975, through U.S. Army Mobile Training Teams active in Central America during the 1980s. In battling communism, the United States thus adopted some of its most objectionable practices&#x2014;subversion abroad, repression at home, and torture.<br>&nbsp;<br>Though torture seems so simple, so banally obvious in its brutality, it does have a lineage that allows us to track distinctive methods across time and continents, through agencies and bureaucracies. Much of the abuse synonymous with the era of authoritarian rule in Asia and Latin America seems to have originated in the United States. While dictatorships in those regions would no doubt have tortured on their own, U.S. training programs provided sophisticated techniques, up-to-date equipment, and moral legitimacy for the practice, producing a clear correspondence between U.S. Cold War policy and the extreme state violence of the authoritarian age. Significantly, torture spread around the Third World with the proliferation of these training programs and then receded when America turned resolutely against the practice at the end of the Cold War. In its pursuit of torturers across the globe for the past forty years, Amnesty International has thus been, in a certain sense, following the trail of CIA programs.<br>&nbsp;<br>In these same troubled decades, U.S. leadership in the global fight against torture and inhumanity has waxed and waned. After World War II, American diplomats played a central role in drafting the UN&#x2019;s Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Geneva Conventions on treatment of prisoners&#x2014;documents that ban torture in both principle and practice.

He&#39;s in Europe. He has been away since before I was born, and I&#39;ve never seen him. Oh, I do wish he&#39;d come home! I want to see him so much! Do you think he would love me?&#39; Meet Elsie Dinsmore, a lovely eight-year-old heiress who lives on a wealthy Southern plantation in the mid-1800&#39;s. Her mother is dead and she has never known her father. Living in her grandfather&#39;s home, she often feels rejected, unloved, and misunderstood. Elsie is sustained by her deep Christian faith and her hope to one day be loved by her father. But will Horace Dinsmore ever come home? Will he love her? Elsie&#39;s Endless Wait is the first book in the Elsie Dinsmore: A Life of Faith series. This captivating story of a young girl&#39;s faith, purity of heart and simple Christian devotion, became an instant American classic over a hundred years ago. Now, in this revised and updated, modern-language edition of the 1868 book by Martha Finley, a whole new generation of readers will meet one of the most beloved fictional heroines of all time.</p><p>For girls ages 10-14 ? About 100 years ago, a bright-eyed little girl named Elsie Dinsmore stole the hearts of parents and children around the world. In 28 novels published between 1868 and 1904, Elsie exemplified true biblical faith in the face of adversity--inspiring generations of girls and young women. Now Elsie&#39;s story comes to life again in a completely updated series adapted from the original novels. While faithful to Martha Finley&#39;s stories and characters, these adaptations also meet the needs and interests of contemporary young readers. We first meet Elsie when she is eight years old and living on her grandfather&#39;s plantation in the South. In succeeding novels, she grows up, finds love, marries and has her own children, and eventually becomes a grandmother. Throughout her life, Elsie faces each new challenge--from personal temptations to the tragedies of war and the loss of loved ones--with strength, courage, and trust in the love and guidance of her Heavenly Father. Zondervan is pleased to offer the first four volumes of this timeless series. Although set in a distant time and place, they are as lively, engaging, and relevant as the best of modern Christian juvenile fiction. The Elsie Dinsmore series promises to provide inspiration and encouragement to a new generation of girls.Mission City Press is a Christian publishing company dedicated to teaching kids to live a life of faith with passionate devotion to Jesus Christ.</p><h2>5 Ingredients or Less Cookbook (Everyday Cookbook Collection)</h2><p>The perfect addition to a busy mom's library, this cookbook is filled with time-trimming recipes!

(By 1938, Taliesin West, in Arizona, was the winter location for Wright's school.) </p><p>The volume is divided into five sections devoted to family, fellowship, work, freedom, and form.

The 200 delectable recipes she offers not only taste superb but also have specific healing properties according to the accumulated wisdom of traditional Chinese medicine.<br><br>The emphasis is on what's good for you, not bad for you. It's primarily a question of balance: eating in harmony with the seasons; countering yin, or cooling, foods (spinach, tomatoes, asparagus, lettuce, seafood) with yang, or hot, foods (ginger, garlic, hot peppers, beef) and neutralizers like rice and noodles.<br><br>Feeling tired? Ms. Simonds offers a spoonful of ginger in her hearty chicken soup. A cold coming on? Try Cantonese-Style Tofu (to sweat out the cold) in Black Bean Sauce (healing to the lungs and digestion). Your immune system needs building up? Wild mushrooms (a cancer deterrent) are tossed with soba noodles (a stress reliever). Concerned about cholesterol and clogged arteries? Instead of giving up all the foods you love, indulge in Yin-Yang Shrimp with Hawthorn Dipping Sauce.<br><br>Whatever your health concerns may be, you will find the right restorative and satisfying recipes. Babies and toddlers have special needs, as do adolescents, pregnant and menopausal women, the aging--and all of these are addressed with specific recommendations. The wealth of information Nina Simonds offers here derives from her extensive research into the evidence amassed over three thousand years by practitioners of Chinese medicine, and from her interviews with leading experts today in food as medicine, who offer their firsthand testimony.<br><br>It is all here in this remarkable book. But, above all, it is the range of dishes, from the exotic to the earthy, that will convince you that you can enjoy marvelous food every day--relishing its good taste and knowing it is good for you.</p><p>Part cookbook, part primer of Chinese medicine, Nina Simonds's <i>A Spoonful of Ginger</i> offers dietary advice, herbal home remedies, and lively, unintimidating Asian recipes for the American home cook. Try Braised Duck with Tangerine Peel and Sweet Potato as a cure for high blood pressure. Baked Black Bean Shrimp might be just the dish to get you over that bout of depression. Simonds presents the ailing reader with concoctions to relieve everything from hangovers to frostbite.<p> And lovers of fine food need not despair--medical advice is kept brief, presumably to make room for more delicious recipes. For example, Steamed Fish with Black Mushrooms and Prosciutto makes no claims to cure anything but hunger. And any volume on health food that features a substantial section on pork (check out Spicy Pork Tenderloin with Leeks and Fennel) can hardly be called austere or old-fashioned. With tastes from all over Asia represented, from Indian curries to Japanese miso, these 200 dishes are tasty riffs on Chinese themes that should cure even the most jaded of palates. <i>--David Kalil</i></p>"At last, a book that has been on my wish list forever! Recipes that not only are full of flavor and taste delicious but most of all are good for us--balanced, energizing, and nurturing. Nina Simonds teaches us about the importance of yin and yang in our diets and shows us that food is fundamental to our lives and our health. Food is our daily medicine, and Nina's book helps us make this connection again."<br>--Nora Pouillon (of Nora and Asia Nora restaurants)</p><h2>Meat for Men</h2><p>This book of revival sermons is Ravenhill&#39;s sequel to the classic book, Why Revival Tarries.

From the audacious Doolittle raid in 1942 to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, award-winning historian Barrett Tillman recounts the saga from the perspectives of American and British aircrews who flew unprecedented missions overthousands of miles of ocean, as well as of the generalsand admirals who commanded them.<p>Whether describing the experiences of bomber crews based in China or the Marianas, fighter pilotson Iwo Jima, or carrier aviators at sea, Tillman provides vivid details of the lives of the fliers and their support personnel. <i>Whirlwind</i> takes readers into the cockpits and gun turrets of the mighty B-29 Superfortress, the largest bomber built up to that time. Tillman dramatically re-creates the sweep of wartime emotions that crews endured on fifteen-hour missions, grappling with the extreme tedium of cramped spaces and with adrenaline spikes in flak-studded skies, knowing that a bailout would put them at the mercy of a merciless enemy or an unforgiving sea.</p><p>A major character is the controversial and brilliant General Curtis LeMay, who rewrote strategic bombing tactics. His command&#x2019;s fire-bombing missions incinerated fully half of Tokyo and many other cities, crippling Japan&#x2019;s industry while still failing to force surrender.</p><p><i>Whirlwind</i> examines the immense logistics and construction efforts necessary to support Superfortresses in Asia and the Mariana Islands, as well as the tireless efforts of engineers to build huge air bases from scratch.It also describes the unheralded missions that American bomber crews flew from the Aleutian Islands to Japan&#x2019;s northernmost Kuril Islands.</p><p>Never has the Japanese side of the story been so thoroughly examined. If Washington, D.C., represented a &#x201c;second front&#x201d; in Army-Navy rivalry, the situation in Tokyo approached a full-contact sport. Tillman&#x2019;s description of Japan&#x2019;s willfully inadequate approach to civil defense is eye-opening. Similarly, he examines the mind-set in Tokyo&#x2019;s war cabinet, which ignored the atomic destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, requiring the emperor&#x2019;s personal intervention to avert a ghastly Allied invasion.</p><p>Tillman shows how, despite the Allies&#x2019; ultimate success, mistakes and shortsighted policies made victory more costly in lives and effort. He faults the lack of a unified command for allowing the Army Air Forces and the Navy to pursue parochial goals at the expense of the larger mission, and he questions the premature commitment of the enormously sophisticated B-29 to the most primitive theater in India and China.</p><p><i>Whirlwind</i> is one of the last histories of World War II written with the contribution of men who fought in it.With unexcelled macro- and microperspectives, <i>Whirlwind</i> is destined to become a standard reference on the war, on multiservice operations, and on the human capacity for individual heroism and national folly.</p></p><p><b>Barrett Tillman</b> is a widely recognized authority on air warfare in World War II and the author of more than forty nonfiction and fiction books on military topics. He has received six awards for history and literature, including the Admiral Arthur Radford Award. He lives in Mesa, Arizona.<b><b><i>Prologue</i><br>OFF HONSHU, APRIL 18, 1942</b></b> <p>REVENGE SPED TOWARD Japan at nearly four miles per minute, borne upon olive-drab wings. </p><p>Flown by America&#x2019;s finest aviator, the lone bomber approached the enemy shore at 200 feet. Three hours after taking off from the aircraft carrier <i>Hornet</i>, the forty-five-year-old pilot was determined to do something that had never been done: bomb Japan. </p><p>Piloting the twin-engine B-25 was Lieutenant Colonel James H. Doolittle, a stocky, balding flier often called a daredevil in the press but best described as master of the calculated risk. In his twenty-five years of flying he had proven both his cool head and his hot hands, winning prestigious races, setting records, and pioneering the crucial science of instrument flight. An oft-published photo showed him standing before his stubby Gee Bee racer with his Phi Beta Kappa key visible beneath his leather jacket. With a Ph.D. in aeronautics, he spoke with an engineer&#x2019;s precision, saying &#x201c;aeroplane&#x201d; and describing friends as &#x201c;chaps.&#x201d; </p><p>Four months earlier, when Japanese carrier aircraft attacked Pearl Harbor, Doolittle had been a major conducting special projects for General Henry H. Arnold, the Army Air Forces chief. America was still reeling from Tokyo&#x2019;s stunning blow against Hawaii as a nonstop onslaught rolled up U.S. and Allied forces across the Pacific: from Guam to Wake Island to the Philippines, East Indies, and the Asian mainland. The nation and President Franklin D. Roosevelt called for retribution. </p><p>Thus was born the First Special Aviation Project. Oddly, it was the brainchild of a submarine officer, Captain Francis Low. He conceived the idea of launching long-range Army bombers from an aircraft carrier and proposed a daring concept: a hit-and-run raid against Japan itself, launched well beyond the limited reach of Navy carrier aircraft. If all went well, sixteen B-25 Mitchells&#x2014;named for the late airpower advocate William &#x201c;Billy&#x201d; Mitchell&#x2014;were to land in China after bombing Japan. </p><p>It was a high-risk operation, calling for volunteer aircrews who were told only that they would be &#x201c;out of the country for two or three months.&#x201d; More men stepped forward than could be used. The crews were selected from all four squadrons of the 17th Bomb Group (Medium), the first B-25 unit. Originally stationed at Pendleton, Oregon, the group had flown antisubmarine patrols along the Pacific coast. A crew of the 17th reported sinking a Japanese sub off the mouth of the Columbia River on Christmas Day 1941, but the boat (the brand-new <i>I-25</i>) escaped to torpedo a tanker a few days later. </p><p>In February the group transferred to South Carolina to hunt U-boats in the Atlantic. A sub kill was claimed off the East Coast, making the 17th the first unit credited with destroying Axis submarines in both oceans. </p><p>The volunteers went to Eglin Field, Florida, to train for the special mission. Mostly they were youngsters: twelve of the sixteen pilots were lieutenants, and only five had won their wings before 1941. Fifteen of the copilots were less than a year out of flight school. Doolittle&#x2019;s crew was typical, with an average age of twenty-five. Besides Doolittle, merely two of the eighty fliers were over thirty: Major John A. Hilger and Technical Sergeant E. V. Scott in Lieutenant Harold Watson&#x2019;s number nine aircraft. </p><p>Flying a loaded Army bomber from an aircraft carrier had never been done. But during tests off the Virginia coast in February, two B-25s got off the <i>Hornet</i> without difficulty, demonstrating that fully armed and fueled bombers could operate safely. The plan went ahead. </p><p>Steaming via the Panama Canal, <i>Hornet</i> rendezvoused with her sister carrier, USS <i>Enterprise</i>, north of Midway on April 12. The task force was commanded by Vice Admiral William F. Halsey, the jut-jawed seadog who would become America&#x2019;s most renowned naval warrior. The &#x201c;Big E,&#x201d; with her regular Navy air group for protection, would escort <i>Hornet</i> to within 450 miles of Japan. There Doolittle&#x2019;s bombers would take off, and the two carriers would turn for home. If the task force was discovered before launch, the B-25s would still take off or be jettisoned, depending on circumstances. </p><p>On the morning of April 18, ten hours before scheduled takeoff, a Japanese picket boat sighted the task force. The vessel was sunk by the cruiser <i>Nashville</i>, but American radiomen overheard the Japanese sending a warning. Doolittle conferred with <i>Hornet</i>&#x2019;s skipper, Captain Marc Mitscher, and decided to launch 170 miles east of the intended point. </p><p>Doolittle lowered his flaps, stood on the brakes, revved his Wright engines, and watched the launch officer. With the carrier&#x2019;s bow rising in the Pacific swells, the officer&#x2019;s flag swept down and Doolittle released the toe brakes. Hauling the control yoke full back, he felt his bomber&#x2019;s wings lift fourteen tons of aluminum, steel, gasoline, ordnance, and living flesh. </p><p>He made it. He circled the ship to get his bearings, then set course for Japan, 713 miles away. The other fifteen Mitchells followed at an average of four-minute intervals. Fully loaded, each bomber had 1,141 gallons of fuel&#x2014;enough for twelve hours or more of cruising at 5,000 feet. Stashed near Chuchow in China&#x2019;s Hunan Province were 30,000 gallons of aviation gasoline and 500 gallons of oil for the Raiders&#x2014;assuming they reached their destination deep in the Asian interior. </p><p>The fliers&#x2019; intended landfall was Inubo Saki, eighty miles east of Tokyo. The twenty-meter promontory with its chalky white lighthouse provided an excellent reference point for the navigators. </p><p>Meanwhile, advance warning of strange aircraft inbound from the sea had been radioed to various headquarters. Many Japanese had seen the Raiders but few realized they were Americans. Some farmers and villagers waved. The noontime arrival of Doolittle&#x2019;s bombers coincided with a scheduled air raid practice, complete with airborne interceptors. But few defenders had any inkling of what was about to happen. </p><p>One observer who immediately recognized the unpleasant facts was Commander Masatake Okumiya, a naval officer at Kasumigaura Airbase twenty-five miles northeast of Tokyo. Glimpsing the silhouette of a B-25 skimming past his airfield, Okumiya realized that the radioed warnings had been ignored. Japan&#x2019;s air defense system&#x2014;such as it was&#x2014;anticipated conventional high-level bombers flying in formations, as Japanese squadrons did over China. </p><p>At noon local time the Americans saw three V-formations, each of three Japanese fighters&#x2014;the first of scores sighted over the enemy homeland. Tokyo knew that something was afoot but lacked details. </p><p>Approaching Tokyo&#x2019;s north-central industrial area at barely rooftop height, Doolittle shoved the throttles forward, climbed to 1,200 feet, leveled off, and lined up a factory complex. Antiaircraft fire burst nearby, shaking the bomber&#x2019;s airframe, but doing no damage. Jimmy Doolittle had a clear shot at his target in good visibility. </p><p>In the glass-enclosed nose, Staff Sergeant Fred Braemer checked his makeshift bombsight, which resembled a child&#x2019;s toy: a protractor mounted on a stick. Mathematically accurate for a given altitude and airspeed, it could place a 500-pound bomb within blast radius of a chosen aim point. The B-25&#x2019;s ordnance was a mix of 500-pound M43 demolition bombs and M54 incendiary clusters, all considered &#x201c;extremely satisfactory.&#x201d; </p><p>Braemer punched the bomb release, felt the Mitchell lift slightly, and became the first of a stream of bombardiers who would drop ordnance on Japan. His four incendiary clusters would provide a beacon for trailing bombers. </p><p>Having shed his load, Doolittle pushed on the control yoke and descended to rooftop height. America&#x2019;s hottest pilot was comfortable speeding at low level: he had won every air race worth entering during the 1920s and 1930s. </p><p>The Raiders&#x2019; targets included petroleum facilities, ammunition stores, aircraft factories, steel mills, and the Tokyo Gas and Electric Company. Lieutenant Travis Hoover&#x2019;s first three-plane flight went to northern Tokyo; Captain David M. Jones&#x2019;s trio attacked the center; and Captain Edward J. York&#x2019;s the southern urban area and northern portion of Tokyo Bay. Captain Charles R. Greening&#x2019;s flight went for Kanagawa, Yokohama, and Yokosuka Navy Yard. He was intercepted by four fighters, two being claimed shot down by B-25 gunners. The fifth flight broke up, its planes attacking Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe. The targets had been selected to spread the damage across fifty miles to prevent the Japanese government from denying that the attack had occurred. </p><p>Probably the most worthwhile target was a ship in Yokosuka dry dock: the 16,700-ton<i>Taigei</i>. The former submarine tender was being converted to a carrier, and it sustained a bomb hit on the bow and several incendiary clusters. Damage was light, and she would join the fleet before year end, renamed <i>Ryuho</i>. Most likely she was attacked by Lieutenant Edgar E. McElroy, with bombardier Sergeant Robert C. Bourgeois. </p><p>Antiaircraft fire was &#x201c;active&#x201d; but inaccurate; no bombers were seriously damaged. Doolittle&#x2019;s crews attacked fast and low, preventing Japanese gunners from getting a clear shot at the B-25s. Barrage balloons&#x2014;as many as five or six together&#x2014;forced only one plane to divert from its briefed course. </p><p>Travis Hoover bombed an arsenal from 900 feet, well below the recommended altitude, as explosions blew wreckage higher than his bomber. Some Raiders reported bombing a residential area containing factories, and inevitably some unintended buildings were hit: Tokyo reported six schools and a military hospital struck. In all, about fifty people were killed and some 400 injured, with ninety buildings reportedly destroyed. </p><p>But not everyone found a target.

Forever afterwards historians have accused him of gross overconfidence, and massively underestimating the calibre of the British commander opposed to him. Andrew Roberts presents an original, highly revisionist view of the relationship between the two greatest captains of their age. Napoleon, who was born in the same year as Wellington - 1769 - fought Wellington by proxy years earlier in the Peninsula War, praising his ruthlessness in private while publicly deriding him as a mere &#39;sepoy general&#39;. In contrast, Wellington publicly lauded Napoleon, saying that his presence on a battlefield was worth forty thousand men, but privately wrote long memoranda lambasting Napoleon&#39;s campaigning techniques. Although Wellington saved Napoleon from execution after Waterloo, Napoleon left money in his will to the man who had tried to assassinate Wellington. Wellington in turn amassed a series of Napoleonic trophies of his great victory, even sleeping with two of the Emperor&#39;s mistresses. The constantly changing relationship between these two nineteenth-century giants forms the basis of Andrew Roberts&#39; compelling study in pride, rivalry, propaganda, nostalgia, and posthumous revenge.</p><p>Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington, spent a lot of time worrying about whether Napoleon Bonaparte, the emperor of France, was a gentleman. Napoleon accused his English foe of being a coward. Yet, Andrew Roberts shows in this dual biography, each accorded the other an odd respect, and, like wrestlers in a ring, studied his foe's moves intently all the way to their fateful encounter at Waterloo.<p> Publicly, Bonaparte and Wellington professed to despise each other. "Even in the boldest things he did there was always a measure of ... meanness," said Wellington of the French emperor, adding later, "Bonaparte's whole life, civil, political, and military, was a fraud." Napoleon said that Wellington "has no courage. He acted out of fear. He had one stroke of fortune, and he knows that such fortune never comes twice." Yet the two, writes Roberts, were very much alike: social outsiders who found their greatness in the army, scholars of a sort, who brought scientific rigor to the study of topography and logistics, and men capable of inspiring great heroism in their soldiers.</p><p> In the end, Roberts suggests, Wellington won his battle, but Napoleon won the war. This intriguing study shows how, and it affords much insight into the workings of these great rivals' minds. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Andrew Roberts took a first in Modern History at Cambridge.

He contributes to <i>New Scientist</i> and <i>Plus Magazine</i> and has published numerous scholarly research papers. </p><p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>THE FIRST MATHEMATICIAN KNOWN BY NAME is Ahmes, an Egyptian scribe who around 1650 BC copied out and studied a list of complex mathematical problems he called the 'ancient writings'. Today, Ahmes' text is known as the <i>Rhind papyrus</i>. From this, and older stone tablets, we know that the scholars of ancient Egypt and Babylon had sophisticated numerical notation and a taste for challenging problems in algebra, geometry and number theory.</p> <p>The study of mathematics, then, is as ancient as civilization; but it also represents the modernity of today's world. In the millennia since Ahmes' work, we have seen scientific and technological progress of which he could not have dreamt. Central to this advance has been the march of mathematics, which has contributed the basic language used in all scientific contexts. Probably mathematics' most fundamental contribution has been in the sphere of physics. Galileo's revolutionary insight in the early 17th century that the universe might yield to a purely mathematical description set the direction towards the world-changing theories of quantum mechanics and relativity.</p> <p>This reliance on mathematics is not confined to the physical sciences. The social sciences depend on techniques of probability and statistics to validate their theories, as indeed do the worlds of business and government. More recently, with the emergence of information technology, mathematics became entangled in another love-affair, with computer science. This too has had a profound impact on our world.</p> <p>As its influence has broadened, the subject of mathematics itself has grown at a startling rate. One of history's greatest mathematicians, Henri Poincare, was described by Eric Temple Bell as 'the last universalist', the final person to have complete mastery of every mathematical discipline that existed during his lifetime. He died in 1912. Today, no-one can claim to have mastered the whole of topology, let alone geometry or logic, and these are just a fraction of the whole of mathematics.</p> <p>Poincare lived through a turbulent period in the history of mathematics. Old ideas had been blown away, and new seeds planted which flourished during the 20th century. The result is that the mathematical world we know today is rich and complex in ways that even the greatest visionaries of the past could not have imagined. My aim in this book is to give an overview of this world and how it came to be. I might have tried to sketch a low-resolution map of the entire mathematical landscape, but this would be neither useful nor entertaining. Instead, I have presented 1001 short 'postcards' from interesting landmarks around the mathematical world that nonetheless give a feel for the bigger picture of mathematics.</p> <p>In the scheme of things, 1001 is a very small number (see the frivolous theorem of arithmetic). My challenge has been to select the real highlights: the truly great theorems, the outstanding open problems and the central ideas. I have also sought to represent the surprises and quirks that make the subject truly fascinating. </p> <p>This book is organized thematically, on three levels. It is divided into ten chapters, each covering a broad subject, beginning with 'Numbers'. Each chapter is subdivided into sections, which are more narrowly focused on a single topic, such as 'Prime numbers'. Each section comprises a series of individual entries, such as the one on the Riemann hypothesis. </p> <p>How you should read <i>Mathematics 1001</i> depends on what you want from it. If you are interested in prime numbers you can read through that section. If you want a quick explanation of the Riemann hypothesis, you can jump straight there; but, because 'a quick explanation of the Riemann hypothesis' is an impossibility, you will then need to rewind a little, to take in the preceding few entries where the necessary prerequisites are laid out. Alternatively you can dip in and out, perhaps finding a new story by following the bold cross-references to different entries in the book. </p> <p>Who is this book aimed at? The answer is anyone with a curiosity about mathematics, from the novice to the informed student or enthusiast. Whatever the reader's current knowledge I'm sure that there will be material here to enlighten and engage. Some parts of the book undoubtedly cover highly complex subjects. That is the nature of the subject; shying away from it would defeat the purpose. However, the book is structured so that the relevant basic concepts precede the complex ones, giving a foundation for understanding. My job in writing has been to discuss all ideas, from the basic to the most abstract, in as direct and focused a way as possible. I have done my best, and have certainly relished the challenge. Now I can only hope that you will enjoy it too.</p> <p>Richard Okura Elwes</p></p><h2>In Xanadu</h2><p>This is an account of the quest which took William Dalrymple and his companions across the width of Asia, along dusty, forgotten roads, through villages and cities full of unexpected hospitality and wildly improbable escapades</p><p>'William Dalrymple has written a delightful book of travels ... a brilliant debut.' - PHILIP GLAZEBROOK, Spectator <p>'A splendid piece of British eccentricity with all manner of echoes: Freya Stark, Peter Fleming, Robert Byron ... Dalrymple is plainly either brilliant, or bonkers, or both.' - ALAN FRANKS, The Times </p><p>'<i>In Xanadu</i> is so uncommonly satisfying because of the rare skill with which William Dalrymple blends his ingredients: history, danger, humour, architecture, people, hardship, politics.' - DERVLA MURPHY, Literary Review </p><p>'Superb ... The vivid, engaging, and often hilarious account of an amazing 12,000-mile quest, His marvellous book - rich with the sights, smells, history and feel of Asia - will become a classic.' - Sunday Express </p><p>'This is travel writing in the grand tradition, with a true whiff of high adventure.

It is full of life and very funny.' - Sunday Times, Books of the Year </p><p>'Outstanding ... William Dalrymple is a natural writer. His models are, perhaps, Peter Fleming and Evelyn Waugh rather than more serious travellers, but he's a better scholar than either. Best of all, he has the gift of comedy ... <i>In Xanadu</i> marks the arrival of a new star.' - Sydney Morning Herald </p><p>'<i>In Xanadu</i> leavens adventure story and scholarly history with farcical dialogue and high-spirited buffoonery. It's a fast, furious, funny read ... clearly the stuff bestsellers are made of.' - SUNIL SETHI, Times of India </p><p>'Rarely does one review a book which so obviously marks the start of a splendid career. Brave and exultant, rich in esoteric knowledge and a sense of the ridiculous ... it is my guess that William Dalrymple will become one of the great English travel writers.' - Eastern Daily Press</p>William Dalrymple was born in Scotland and brought up on the shores of the Firth of Forth. He wrote the highly acclaimed bestseller <i>In Xanadu</i> when he was twenty-two. The book won the 1990 Yorkshire Post Best First Work Award and a Scottish Arts Council Spring Book Award; it was also shortlisted for the John Llewelyn Rhys Memorial Prize. in 1989 Dalrymple moved to Delhi where he lived for six years researching his second book, <i>City of Djinns</i>, which won the 1994 Thomas Cook Travel Book Award and the Sunday Times Young British Writer of the Year Award. His third book, the acclaimed <i>From the Holy Mountain</i>, was awarded the Scottish Arts Council Autumn Book Award for 1997; it was also shortlisted for the 1998 Thomas Cook Travel Book Award, the John Llewelyn Rhys Memorial Prize and the Duff Cooper Prize. Dalrymple was recently elected the youngest Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and the Royal Asiatic Society. He has written and presented a series about the architecture of the Raj for Channel 4 and is currently working on a major BBC series about the religions of India.

Where did we come from and how do we return home? What&#39;s the difference between Angels, Star Beings and Space Beings? This much beloved book is a vast handbook of remembrance which has touched many and transformed lives. There have been eight printings so far.</p><p>This beloved book is a great handbook of remembrance. So many people have contacted me and wondered how I knew "their" story and were surprised that there were others who felt the same sense of isolation and aloneness. "We gather our reawakened memories as if pearls strung together on a cord, endeavoring to recreate our necklace of remembrance. " "The Star-Borne" evokes a profound healing for those who have wondered why and how they ended up on planet Earth. It explains the choices we have made to come here and helps us know that we are not alone. This book also helps us get in touch with the vastness of our celestial being, what used to be called our Higher Self. It takes us through our initial descent into matter and shows us what we have come here to achieve. "The Star-Borne" is full of information which is not available elsewhere. It speaks of matters which are lodged deep within our cellular memories, but have been erased over time from our conscious memories. And it serves a powerful catalyst to bring those memories forward, to embrace our full vastness. <p>After we have done that, then we can realize that Home is here. We have never left. And there is nothing to return to except for the fullness of our core beings. A few years ago, I greatly revised this book which is now in its seventh edition. It has been a bestseller for many years and will continue to help us on our accelerated journey into the Greater Reality.</p>Beloved Star-Borne Ones, Now is the time to remember....By our seeing of the Unseen, By our listening to the fullness of Silence, By our merging with our Angelic Presence, We open ourselves to the multi-dimensional Frequencies emanating from On High. Each of us who has touched the stars Becomes a lantern which illuminates All with starry light....This is an accelerated path homeward Which leads to the New Octave Of the Greater Reality.</p><h2>Remarkable Recovery: What Extraordinary Healings Tell Us About Getting Well and Staying Well</h2><p>A study of individuals who miraculously recovered from terminal illnesses draws on medical, genetic, psychological, and spiritual profiles to argue that the key to healing lies in the functioning of the immune system. 80,000 first printing. $75,000 ad/promo.</p><p>Not all of them had peaceful, loving, trusting dispositions- that was clear. Some were downright ornery. But over and over we took note of a certain quality that we came to call "congruence"- an impression that these people, in the midst of crisis, had discovered a way to be deeply true to themselves, manifesting a set of behaviors growing from the roots of their being. <p> Certain of Dr. Oliver's cases have particularly strained his understanding of biological science. He fishes from a file cabinet the lung X rays of his "famous remission," a woman he treated between 1981 and 1983. Her kidney tumor had metastasized to her lungs, and her prognosis was terminal. But Oliver found that her tumors waxed and waned not with the inexorable progress of kidney cancer, but with the ups and downs of her relationship with her physically abusive husband.</p>In a spectacular contribution to what is known about the mind/body connection, the authors investigate cases of remarkable recovery, offering many illuminating thoughts on the nature of healing. When the authors began their exploration of remarkable healings, certain facts became obvious: the medical community maintained an uneasy silence on the subject, andon those rare occasions when they did discuss these cases, they seemed admiring, but strangely lacking in simple curiosity, much less scientific methodology. They asked no questions, or none of the right questions. Caryle Hirshberg and Marc Ian Barasch attempt to ask all the right questions-about the lifestyles, attitudes, hobbies, intimate relationships, social support, and spiritual and religious beliefs and practices of the extraordinary men, women and children whose stories of miraculous healings they tell. In the process, they begin to discover those qualities that may be associated with healing, finding that intuition, determination, faith, even playing a musical instrument, may improve our chances of recovery. -- <i>From The WomanSource Catalog &amp; Review: Tools for Connecting the Community for Women; review by Patricia Pettijohn</i></p><h2>Sir Gregor Macgregor and the Land That Never Was</h2><p>On a cold January morning in 1823, a group of Scottish immigrants set sail from the port of Leith. They were headed for the nation of Poyais in Central America where, they were told, they would find rich and fertile soils, a balmy climate and beautiful, civilized cities. A month later they landed on the swamp-infested Mosquito Coast and were forced to realize that they had been the victims of one of the most elaborate hoaxes in history. The land they had been sold was non-existent; the banknotes and guidebooks they carried with them were forgeries; their documents were worthless. Poyais was a fiction. The man responsible was General Sir Gregor MacGregor, &#34;the Prince of Poyais&#34;, a flamboyant and charismatic character who had fought as a mercenary in Simon Bolivar&#39;s army. On his return to Britain he reinvented himself and was welcomed into society.

A group of English Catholics, seeking to unseat the king and reintroduce Catholicism as the state religion, daringly placed thirty-six barrels of gunpowder in a cellar under the Palace of Westminster. Their aim was to ignite the gunpowder at the opening of the Parliamentary session. Though the charismatic Catholic, Robert Catesby, was the group's leader, it was the devout Guy Fawkes who emerged as its most famous member, as he was the one who was captured and who revealed under torture the names of his fellow plotters. In the aftermath of their arrests, conditions grew worse for English Catholics, as legal penalties against them were stiffened and public sentiment became rabidly intolerant.<p></p><p>In a narrative that reads like a gripping detective story, Antonia Fraser has untangled the web of religion, politics, and personalities that surrounded that fateful night of November 5. And, in examining the lengths to which individuals will go for their faith, she finds in this long-ago event a reflection of the religion-inspired terrorism that has produced gunpowder plots of our own time.</p></p><h2>This Equals That</h2><p>Aimed at children ages five and up, this clever and surprising picture book by artists and collaborators, Jason Fulford and Tamara Shopsin, takes young viewers on a whimsical journey while teaching them associative thinking and visual language, as well as colors, shapes and numbers. Through a simple narrative and a rhythmic sequence of photographs, the book generates multiple meanings, making the experience of reading the book interactive&#x2014;parent and child must ask questions and come up with their own answers, drawing on the child's imagination. Each spread presents a new relationship that changes and shifts as the book unfolds, with the last picture relating again to the first, forming a circle. Through playful and inspired sequencing, everyday scenes are transformed into a game of pairs, enjoyable for adults and children alike.</p><p>Jason Fulford is a photographer and cofounder of the non-profit publisher J&amp;L Books. He has lectured at more than a dozen art schools and universities and is a contributing editor to Blind Spot magazine. Fulford's photographs have been featured in Harper's, the New York Times Magazine, Time, Blind Spot, Aperture, and on book jackets for Don DeLillo, John Updike, Bertrand Russell, Jorge Luis Borges, Terry Eagleton, Ernest Hemingway and Richard Ford. His published books include Sunbird (2000), Crushed (2003), Raising Frogs for $$$ (2006), The Mushroom Collector (2010) and Hotel Oracle (2013).<br><br>Tamara Shopsin is a graphic designer and illustrator whose work has been featured in The New York Times, Good, Time, Wired, and Newsweek. She has designed book jackets for authors including Jorge Luis Borges, Charles Lindbergh, and Vladimir Nabokov. Two volumes of her drawings have been published under the titles "C est le Pied!" and "C est le Pied II". In her spare time she creates and sells novelties and cracks eggs at her family's restaurant in New York, Shopsip's. She is currently a 2012 fellow with the nonprofit Code for America.Gr 3 Up&#x2014;The only words in this book are those in the opening rhyme: "The book is a circle/Made up of squares/Turn the pages/Consider the pairs." While the rhyme may seem enigmatic at first, children will quickly deduce what they are being asked to do. The pairs that follow are sharp full-color photographs (each one and facing its mate on square-shaped pages). They show familiar objects and street and natural scenes that relate in one way or another to each other&#x2014;through the shapes, colors, or patterns depicted or something a bit more abstract. Once viewers determine what the relationship(s) might be, they turn the page to find the recto image is now in the verso position, juxtaposed with a different photo. In one pairing, children will ponder how a large, ominous shadow of the outstretched limbs of a tree relates to a huge balloon of a sneering King Kong that sits atop a building, its arms raised high above its head. As the rhyme suggests, the book comes full circle when the same photo that opens the book, also ends it. A playful look at the ever-changing nature of relationships and an exercise in visual literacy.&#x2014;Daryl Grabarek, School Library Journal</p><h2>Inheritance: The Story of Knole and the Sackvilles</h2><p><p>Since its purchase in 1604 by Thomas Sackville, first Earl of Dorset, the house at Knole, Kent, has been inhabited by thirteen generations of a single aristocratic family, the Sackvilles. Here, drawing on a wealth of unpublished letters, archives, and images, the current incumbent of the seat, Robert Sackville-West, paints a vivid and intimate portrait of the vast, labyrinthine house and the close relationships his colorful ancestors formed within it.</p><p><i>Inheritance</i> is the story of a house and its inhabitants, a family described by Vita Sackville-West as "a race too prodigal, too amorous, too weak, too indolent, and too melancholy; a rotten lot, and nearly all starkstaring mad." Where some reveled in the hedonism of aristocratic life, others rebelled against a house that, in time, would disinherit them, shutting its doors to them forever. It's a drama in which the house itself is a principal character, its fortunes often mirroring those of the family. Every detail holds a story: the portraits, and all the items the subjects of those portraits left behind, point to pivotal moments in history; all the rooms, and the objects that fill them, are freighted with an emotional significance that has been handed down from generation to generation.</p><p>Now owned by the National Trust, Knole is today one of the largest houses in England, visited by thousands annually and housing one of the country's finest collections of secondhand Royal furniture. It's a pleasure to follow Robert Sackville-West as he unravels the private life of a public place on a fascinating, masterful, four-hundred-year tour through the memories and memorabilia, political, financial, and domestic, of his extraordinary family.</p></p><p><p>After studying History at Oxford University, Robert Sackville-West worked in publishing, founding Toucan Books in 1985, which creates illustrated non-fiction books for an international market. He now combines that with chairing Knole Estates, the property and investment company which runs the Sackville family's interests at Knole. In 2008, he and his wife and three children moved in the house, which has been occupied by the Sackville family for 400 years.</p>Knole is best-known as the family home of writer Vita Sackville-West and famously memorialized in her lover Virginia Woolf's elegiac novel Orlando, It's a Renaissance palace in Kent that, with 365 rooms and spread over four acres, is one of the largest private houses in England. Knole has been inhabited for the past 400 years by 13 generations of a single family, the Sackvilles. Elizabeth I's immensely wealthy cousin Thomas Sackville, Earl of Dorset, an acclaimed poet and moderately corrupt but quite successful politician, acquired Knole in 1604 and at the age of 70 embarked on a massive building program, turning a ramshackle medieval mansion (previously owned by Henry VIII and Elizabeth) into a great show house. The author relates this rich history of Knole inhabitants, filled with gadabouts, swashbuckling royalists, deft politicians, art collectors, and schemers sure to enchant and delight readers. The author--who as the 7th Lord Sackville shares the house with the National Trust and 80,000 annual visitors--pens candid, intelligent, insightful mini-biographies of the various residents, giving readers a glimpse into England's aristocratic heritage while whetting anglophiles' appetites to see Knole for themselves.

Publication of the miniatures contained in the most beautiful manuscript of the Divine comedy, kept at the Biblioteca nazionale marciana of Venice.</p><p>Text: English (translation)</p><h2>Seabiscuit : The True Story of Three Men and a Racehorse</h2><p>The true story of three men and their dreams for a racehorse -- Seabiscuit -- that symbolised a pivotal moment in American history, as the 20th-century&#39;s greatest nation found the courage to bet on itself to win against the odds. Now a major motion picture directed by Gary Ross and starring Toby Maguire and Jeff Daniels. In 1936 the habits of 19th-century America were finally consigned to history, just as Margaret Mitchell&#39;s &#34;Gone with the Wind&#34; was published. In their place, modern America was born. But what defined this new era? Nothing more than the story of Seabiscuit, a stunted colt with asymmetrical knees that had for two years been hacked around no-good race tracks leading to permanent leg damage. Yet by 1937 Seabiscuit could draw crowds of 60,000 and had more newspaper column inches devoted to him than Mussolini, Hitler or Roosevelt, his popularity peaking during his appearances at the Santa Anita Handicap. America had gone to the races for the first time since the Depression and fallen in love with a misshapen colt of great character. Now it wanted a winner. &#39;Seabiscuit&#39; is also the story of three men: Tom Smith, a former Wild West showman was the trainer; Red Pollard, abandoned by his poverty-stricken family at a race track became the rider; and Charles Howard, a pioneer car manufacturer in San Francisco in the 1920s was the owner and financier. These three combined to create the legend of Seabiscuit and epitomise a dream for the emerging new America.</p><p>He didn't <i>look</i> like much. With his smallish stature, knobby knees, and slightly crooked forelegs, he looked more like a cow pony than a thoroughbred. But looks aren't everything; his quality, an admirer once wrote, "was mostly in his heart." Laura Hillenbrand tells the story of the horse who became a cultural icon in <i>Seabiscuit: An American Legend</i>.<p> Seabiscuit rose to prominence with the help of an unlikely triumvirate: owner Charles Howard, an automobile baron who once declared that "the day of the horse is past"; trainer Tom Smith, a man who "had cultivated an almost mystical communication with horses"; and jockey Red Pollard, who was down on his luck when he charmed a then-surly horse with his calm demeanor and a sugar cube. Hillenbrand details the ups and downs of "team Seabiscuit," from early training sessions to record-breaking victories, and from serious injury to "Horse of the Year"--as well as the Biscuit's fabled rivalry with War Admiral. She also describes the world of horseracing in the 1930s, from the snobbery of Eastern journalists regarding Western horses and public fascination with the great thoroughbreds to the jockeys' torturous weight-loss regimens, including saunas in rubber suits, strong purgatives, even tapeworms.</p><p> Along the way, Hillenbrand paints wonderful images: tears in Tom Smith's eyes as his hero, legendary trainer James Fitzsimmons, asked to hold Seabiscuit's bridle while the horse was saddled; critically injured Red Pollard, whose chest was crushed in a racing accident a few weeks before, listening to the San Antonio Handicap from his hospital bed, cheering "Get going, Biscuit! Get 'em, you old devil!"; Seabiscuit happily posing for photographers for several minutes on end; other horses refusing to work out with Seabiscuit because he teased and taunted them with his blistering speed.</p><p> Though sometimes her prose takes on a distinctly purple hue ("His history had the ethereal quality of hoofprints in windblown snow"; "The California sunlight had the pewter cast of a declining season"), Hillenbrand has crafted a delightful book. Wire to wire, <i>Seabiscuit</i> is a winner. Highly recommended. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p>A deluxe illustrated edition of one of the most beloved books of our time, with nearly 150 historic photographs personally selected by the author <br> <br>The spellbinding true story of how three men and a great racehorse captivated a nation, Laura Hillenbrand?s <i>Seabiscuit: An American Legend</i> became an immediate number one bestseller and cultural phenomenon upon its publication in 2001. Named one of the best books of the year by more than twenty publications?including <i>The New York Times, The Washington Post, Time, People, USA Today,</i> and <i>The Economist</i>?Seabiscuit was also honored as the BookSense Nonfiction Book of the Year and the William Hill Sports Book of the Year, and was a finalist for several other major prizes, including the National Book Critics Circle Award and the <i> Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize. <br> <br>For this lavishly illustrated special edition, author Laura Hillenbrand has written a new Introduction and selected nearly 150 rare photographs from historic archives and private collections. Seabiscuit tells the story of three remarkable men: Charles Howard, a bicycle repairman who made a fortune by introducing the automobile to the American West; Red Pollard, a failed prizefighter and failing jockey who was abandoned as a boy at a makeshift racetrack; and Tom Smith, an enigmatic mustang breaker who came from the vanishing frontier, bearing generations of lost wisdom about the secrets of horses. <br> <br>In the sultry summer of 1936, the lives of these men converged around a bad-legged, floundering racehorse named Seabiscuit. Forming an improbable partnership, they transformed the horse into one of the most extraordinary competitors in sports history. In four tumultuous years, the rags-to-riches horse overcame a phenomenal run of misfortune to emerge as an American cultural icon, drawing an immense following, prompting an avalanche of merchandising, and establishing himself as the single biggest newsmaker of 1938?receiving more coverage than FDR, Hitler, or any other public figure. <br> <br> <b>Seabiscuit</b> is an inspiring tale of unlikely heroes, a classic story of three embattled individuals and a remarkable racehorse overcoming the odds in the Great Depression.</p><h2>The House of Thunder</h2><p>Slowly and painfully recovering in a hospital room from the terrible accident that has left her with amnesia, a woman begins to solve the mysteries of her past, beginning with one stormy night of violence waged by four young men.

This new edition of&nbsp;<em>The Collected Stories of William Carlos Williams</em>&nbsp;contains all fifty-two stories combining the early collections&nbsp;<em>The Knife of the Times</em>&nbsp;(1932),&nbsp;<em>Life Along the Passaic</em>&nbsp;(1938) with the later collection&nbsp;<em>Make Light of It</em>&nbsp;(1950) and the great long story, &#x201c;The Farmers&#x2019; Daughters&#x201d; (1956). When these stories first appeared, their vitality and immediacy shocked many readers, as did the blunt, idiosyncratic speech of Williams&#x2019; immigrant and working-class characters. But the passage of time has silenced the detractors, and what shines in the best of these stories is the unflinching honesty and deep humanity of Williams&#x2019; portraits, burnished by the seeming artlessness which only the greatest masters command.</p><p>Besides being a practicing physician, William Carlos Williams (1883&#x2013;1963) was a poet, short-story writer, novelist, translator, playwright, and essayist whose contribution to the development of modern American poetry grew out of his commitment to recording the "local" experience of Rutherford, New Jersey, and its environs.This is a reprint of the collection published in 1961 as The Farmer's Daughters. LJ's reviewer observed that "these are not short stories in the accepted technical sense of the word. Call them rather vignettes for some are less than two pages long, or even diagnoses for they reflect to a great extent the author's experiences as a practicing physician who has treated man not only as an object for the application of drugs but also as material for the work of art" (LJ 12/1/61). This edition also contains a new introduction by Sherwin B. Nuland, M.D., who offers a doctor's perspective on Williams.

These entries set the structure for the rest of the novel, which is also told mainly through journal entries and letters. This first section introduces Harker, who is a recently promoted English solicitor (a type of attorney). Harker travels eastward across Europe from London to Transylvania, where he is going to meet Count Dracula and explain to the count the particulars of his London real estate purchase. As he travels across the country to the castle, he notices the reaction of various area residents who are frightened by Dracula&#x2019;s name.

Nina Auerbach of the University of Pennsylvania (author of <i>Our Vampires, Ourselves</i>) and horror scholar David J.

Especially fascinating are excerpts from materials that Bram Stoker consulted in his research for the book, and his working papers over the several years he was composing it. The selection of criticism includes essays on how <i>Dracula</i> deals with female sexuality, gender inversion, homoerotic elements, and Victorian fears of "reverse colonization" by politically turbulent Transylvania.While serving as actor Henry Irving&#39;s business manager at the Lyceum Theatre in London, Bram Stoker (1847-1912) also pursued his literary interests.

Lethem's story centers around two unlikely friends, Chase Insteadman, a genial nonentity who was once a child sitcom star and now is best known as the loyal fiancï¿½ of a space-stranded astronaut, and Perkus Tooth, a skinny, moody, underemployed cultural critic. Chase and Perkus are free-floating, dope-dependent bohemians in a borough built on ambition, living on its margins but with surprising access to its centers of power, even to the city's billionaire mayor. Paranoiac Perkus sees urgent plots everywhere--in the font of <i>The New Yorker</i>, in an old VHS copy of <i>Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid</i>--but <i>Chronic City</i>, despite the presence of death, politics, and a mysterious, marauding tiger, is itself light on plot. Eschewing dramatic staples like romance and artistic creation for the more meandering passions of friendship and observation, <i>Chronic City</i> thrives instead on the brilliance of Lethem's ear and eye. Every page is a pleasure of pitch-perfect banter and spot-on cultural satire, cut sharply with the melancholic sense that being able to explain your city doesn't make you any more capable of living in it. <i>--Tom Nissley</i><p>JONATHAN LETHEM is the author of seven novels.

It seems like a wish come true. But she quickly realizes that not all change is positive. Her dad has a mysterious new girlfriend, Moura, who slowly drives a wedge between Jen and her father. Furthermore, Moura has an unusually strong&#x2014;almost obsessive&#x2014;interest in the antiques that fill the mansion, especially a beautiful glass globe that Jen finds hanging in a window. When Jen&#x2019;s cat accidentally breaks the globe, which Moura calls a &#x201c;witch catcher,&#x201d; strange things begin to happen. . . . <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An odd-looking girl wearing a torn dress appears, seemingly out of nowhere, and Moura&#x2019;s behavior becomes more sinister, leading Jen to believe that her father is a pawn in an evil scheme. Soon Jen finds herself caught in the midst of a supernatural war, with the fate of an enchanted race&#x2014;and her family&#x2014;at stake. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspired by the age-old legend of witch catchers, Mary Downing Hahn brings a magical cast of characters to life in this compelling fantasy adventure.

She&#x2019;d finally removed her glasses. They lay on the table beside her cup, casting colored shadows on the tablecloth. Her eyes were large and a light greenish gray, the pupils ringed with yellow. &#x201c;Have a seat, Jen.&#x201d; Moura motioned toward a chair. Her lips curved briefly into a smile that didn&#x2019;t reach her strange eyes. Somehow she made me feel unwelcome without being anything but polite.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reluctantly, I slid into the seat and sat there tongue-tied with discomfort, the third person, totally unnecessary. Dad patted my hand, but I had a feeling he wished I hadn&#x2019;t interrupted the conversation. Cadoc lay at Moura&#x2019;s feet, his head resting on her sandals. When he saw me, he raised his head and stared with eyes as pale and cold as his mistress&#x2019;s. Although he didn&#x2019;t growl, I moved my chair away, ready to run if he so much as opened his mouth. I was glad Tink hadn&#x2019;t followed me downstairs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moura patted the dog&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;Cadoc won&#x2019;t hurt you, Jen,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Come closer.&#x201d; Feeling childish, I forced myself to do as she said. Her perfume was strong, cloying. It made my head ache just to sit near her. And her eyes . . . When she looked at me, I wished she&#x2019;d kept her glasses on.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Cadoc,&#x201d; Moura said, &#x201c;this is Jen.&#x201d; The dog sat up and extended a paw for me to shake. I took it gingerly, feeling the hard claws housed in soft fur and velvety footpads. &#x201c;Pleased to meet you,&#x201d; I lied.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction finished, I backed away from Moura and her dog, relishing the distance from both of them. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t he amazing?&#x201d; Dad asked me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Moura has trained that dog perfectly.&#x201d; I nodded, but I was glad to see Cadoc lie down again. &#x201c;Perhaps we could take a walk with Cadoc one fine day,&#x201d; Moura suggested to me. &#x201c;I know a lovely path by the river.&#x201d; Dad went on for a while about how much fun it would be to ramble through the woods with the scariest dog I&#x2018;d ever seen. Of course, he didn&#x2019;t think Cadoc was scary. No, he was Moura&#x2019;s dog and just as perfect as she was.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During a lull in the conversation, I asked Moura what she thought of Great-Uncle Thaddeus&#x2019;s things.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled. &#x201c;The house is full of treasures&#x2014;paintings, sculpture, porcelain, silver, old books. If your father wants to sell his great-uncle&#x2019;s possessions, he&#x2019;ll be a rich man indeed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, the dining-room furniture alone is worth at least fifteen thousand dollars.&#x201d; I stared at her, absolutely amazed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Who on earth would pay that much for old furniture?&#x201d; &#x201c;Collectors,&#x201d; Moura said, &#x201c;dealers, maybe even a museum. The set is solid walnut, handcrafted, and in perfect condition.&#x201d; I turned to Dad. &#x201c;Are you going to sell it?&#x201d; He shrugged. &#x201c;Maybe, maybe not. We just moved in, Jen. I want to live with Uncle Thaddeus&#x2019;s things for a while before I make any decisions.&#x201d; When Dad paused to sip his tea, Moura turned to me, her eyes keen. &#x201c;I was expecting to find something I was told your uncle owned,&#x201d; she said slowly, &#x201c;but I didn&#x2019;t see it anywhere.&#x201d; &#x201c;What were you looking for?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;A glass globe, about this big.&#x201d; Moura cupped her hands to show me. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s decorated with a swirling pattern of colors. There&#x2019;s a little spout on one side and a loop at the top so it can be hung in a window.&#x201d; While Moura described my globe, I drank my tea silently. I didn&#x2019;t dare look at my father for fear I&#x2019;d give myself away. The globe was mine. I&#x2019;d found it, and I wasn&#x2019;t going to give it to anyone&#x2014;especially Moura.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Some people call it a sun catcher,&#x201d; Moura went on, &#x201c;but its original name was witch catcher. In the old days, superstitious people believed the pretty pattern in the glass had the power to draw witches and other evil creatures through the spout and into the globe. Trapped inside, the witch was powerless.&#x201d; &#x201c;Is that right?&#x201d; Dad leaned toward Moura, amused by her story. More worried than amused, I studied the tea leaves in my cup, wishing I could tell my own fortune. I was haunted by the girl I&#x2019;d seen in the painting, her hands pressed against what I&#x2019;d thought was a glass wall. Had Great-Uncle Thaddeus captured a witch in that globe? Was she at this very moment hidden in my closet?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moura smiled her strange smile. &#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s certainly true that the globes were called witch catchers, and people hung them in their windoows to protect themselves.&#x201d; She stared for a moment into her own teacup, her long slender fingers curved around the fragile china. &#x201c;Today witch catchers are valued for their beauty, but I find their history fascinating. Suppose the old superstitions are true and witttttches actually are held captive in those pretty globes? Suppose you broke one and the witch escaped?&#x201d; As she spoke, Moura gazed directly at me. Her voice was light, even playful, but the expression in her eyes was anything but humorous.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shrugged and looked away. If Moura thought she could scare me into confessing I had the trap, she was mistaken.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Nonsense,&#x201d; Dad said with a laugh.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;These days, you won&#x2019;t find witches roaming the countryside just waiting to be trapped in glass globes.&#x201d; &#x201c;You&#x2019;d be surprised,&#x201d; Moura said in a voice so low Dad didn&#x2019;t seem to hear. But I did. Maybe because she was looking at me, not my father. Despite myself, I shivered. Was she warning me? Or just trying to scare me?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I have a client who collects witch catchers,&#x201d; Moura went on in a normal voice. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s most anxious to acquire another. I know for a fact he&#x2019;s willing to pay several hundred dollars for the one your uncle owned.&#x201d; Her head swung toward me, and her long hair swirled around her pale face. &#x201c;Have you seen the globe, Jen?&#x201d; Taken by surprise, I shook my head.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near my feet Cadoc stirred and sighed, his breath warm on my leg.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t explored the tower,&#x201d; Dad said. &#x201c;Maybe Uncle Thaddeus kept it up there.&#x201d; &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing in the tower,&#x201d; I said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You told me so yourself.&#x201d; &#x201c;Would you mind if I had a look?&#x201d; Moura asked. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll all go,&#x201d; Dad said. &#x201c;Jen&#x2019;s dying to explore the place.&#x201d; &#x201c;But you told me it&#x2019;s not safe,&#x201d; I reminded him. &#x201c;You said it was about to fall down.&#x201d; Dad laughed. &#x201c;Goodness, Jen, I didn&#x2019;t think you believed anything I told you.&#x201d; He meant it as a joke, but his words stung. Sarcasm wasn&#x2019;t Dad&#x2019;s style. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure the tower&#x2019;s perfectly safe,&#x201d; Moura said, apparently missing both the joke and the sarcasm.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting to her feet, she reached for her glasses. Reluctantly, I followed Dad and Moura outside. Cadoc ran gracefully ahead, his long, lithe body stretching as if his bones were strung together with elastic.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing Dad noticed, of course, was the broken lock. He turned to me and frowned. &#x201c;Do you know anything about this, Jen?&#x201d; &#x201c;A burglar could have done it last night,&#x201d; I said, choosing my words carefully. Not a lie, but not quite the truth, either.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dad stared at me, his eyes filled with suspicion. &#x201c;What thief would come all the way out here just to break into this old ruin?&#x201d; Moura surprised me by saying, &#x201c;Jen may be right, Hugh. We&#x2019;ve had several robberies lately. Probably teenagers with nothing else to do.&#x201d; Dad obviously didn&#x2019;t want to argue with Moura, but I could tell he wasn&#x2019;t convinced I was being truthful.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without saying more, he shoved the door open, letting out a whiff of dank, moldy air. Moura stepped back, her nose wrinkled in distaste. Dad smiled. &#x201c;The tower&#x2019;s been closed for so long, it&#x2019;s no wonder it smells bad. Once we get to the top, you won&#x2019;t notice the odor.&#x201d; When Moura hesitated, Dad took her arm.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Come on, Moura. Where&#x2019;s your sense of adventure?&#x201d; Cadoc ran up the winding stairs, ahead of us all. Moura allowed Dad to lead her across the threshold and up the creaky old stairs, but the expression of distaste stayed on her face. Unfortunately, I hadn&#x2019;t thought to straighten up before I&#x2019;d left. The chair stood on the table where I&#x2019;d put it. Worse yet, the dust was marked with footprints, clearly showing the ridges on the soles of my running shoes. Dad frowned at me. &#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s been up here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;With feet just about the size of yours. How do you explain that, Jen?&#x201d; Moura surprised me again by laughing.&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Children will be children,&#x201d; she told Dad. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re as curious as cats. And just as devious.&#x201d; &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hope they have nine lives as well.&#x201d; Dad gave me a look that plainly said I&#x2019;d hear more about this later.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretending indifference, I watched the two of them search the room. Dad bumped his head on a low rafter. Moura coughed. A pigeon took wing from a rafter and flew out a broken window. Mice scurried from one hiding place to another. Cadoc made no move to chase them. He seemed more interested in prowling about, sniffing at things.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they&#x2019;d looked in all the obvious places, Dad turned his attention to his great-uncle&#x2019;s paintings, but Moura came to me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure you didn&#x2019;t see the witch catcher, Jen?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might have been hanging in one of the windows.&#x201d; I gave Moura the sweet look that worked so well on my teachers. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t stay up here very long. The dust bothered me.&#x201d; As proof, I covered my mouth and coughed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;But why is the chair on the table?&#x201d; Moura asked. &#x201c;Was there something up there that you were trying to reach?&#x201d; I shrugged. &#x201c;I wanted to see out the window better.&#x201d; Moura continued studying me, her eyes hidden behind those tinted glasses. No trace of her earlier smile lingered on her lips. Touching Dad&#x2019;s shoulder, she said, &#x201c;I think we&#x2019;ve seen all there is to see, Hugh.&#x201d; &#x201c;Before we go, take a look at these paintings. They&#x2019;re quite remarkable.&#x201d; Dad gave Moura a warm smile. &#x201c;They remind me of Yeats&#x2019;s poetry somehow. Do you remember &#x2018;The Stolen Child&#x2019;?&#x201d; Moura nodded. &#x201c;&#x2018;Come away, O human child! . . . For the world&#x2019;s more full of weeping than you can understand,&#x2019;&#x201d; she quoted softly, eyeing me while she spoke. In her voice, the words had a menacing quality I&#x2019;d never noticed when Dad read the poem to me. Dad nodded, unaware of anything but Moura&#x2019;s knowledge of the poem he loved. &#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s the one I was thinking of. Fairies and all their ambiguity.&#x201d; He pointed to the painting on the easel. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a pity Uncle Thaddeus never finished this one&#x2014;or the others of the same face. They have an unearthly quality, altogether unsettling. Is she scared? Is she angry? Is she good or evil?&#x201d; Moura glanced at me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d say she&#x2019;s wicked, the very sort of creature who finds witch catchers irresistible. Look at her eyes&#x2014;the curious slant, the hint of evil in their depths.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&#x2019;s not someone I&#x2019;d want to meet in a dark wood.&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes, I see what you mean.&#x201d; Dad turned to me. &#x201c;How about you, Jen? What do you think of her?&#x201d; &#x201c;She looks scared.&#x201d; I edged away and almost stumbled over Cadoc, who was lying on the floor behind me. He growled so softly no one heard but me. &#x201c;Not evil.&#x201d; Moura removed her glasses and contemplated the paintings, her head tilted so that her hair fell straight and shiny to one side. &#x201c;The same client who collects witch catchers has a keen interest in fairy lore. Shall I tell him about these paintings? He&#x2019;d be willing to pay a great deal for them.&#x201d; Dad hesitated before he answered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure I want to part with them just yet,&#x201d; he said at last. &#x201c;But if your client wants to look at them, I have no objection.&#x201d; Taking the paintings with him, Dad led the way downstairs with Moura behind him, her long skirt flowing. Cadoc followed, close at her heels. I brought up the rear, allowing plenty of distance between myself and the dog. At the bottom of the steps, I lingered in the tower doorway and watched Dad and Moura walk across the lawn, their heads close, talking softly. Cadoc loped in circles around them, as lean and graceful as a greyhound but far more menacing. When I caught up with them, I heard Moura tell Dad, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry I can&#x2019;t accept your invitation. I have a business engagement this evening. Perhaps tomorrow night?&#x201d; Dad&#x2019;s face brightened. &#x201c;That will be even better. I&#x2019;ll have more time to plan a great dinner for you.&#x201d; Moura waved to Dad and me and got into her car. Cadoc made himself comfortable in the passenger seat, and off they went, leaving a cloud of dust behind. As soon as the car was out-of-sight, Dad turned to me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m disappointed in you, Jen,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Not only did you go into the tower, but you lied about it. Worse yet, I have a feeling you know exactly where that witch catcher is.&#x201d; Ashamed to meet his eyes, I looked at the ground and shook my head. Even though it upset me to lie to my father, I had no intention of giving the glass globe to Moura. I enjoyed knowing I had something she wanted.</p> <p>That night, I retrieved the globe from its hiding place and stared into the glass. I saw nothing. No witch. No evil spirit. It was all nonsense anyway. How could a full-size witch be sucked into a glass globe no bigger than a softball?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strung a green ribbon through the loop at the top and tied the ribbon around my curtain rod. The globe spun slowly in the night breeze, catching light from the moon. Tink watched the globe turn, his eyes big. He rose on his hind legs as if he longed to bat it back and forth like one of his toys. &#x201c;Oh, no, you don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; I scooped him up, and he snuggled against me purring, his eyes fixed on the globe. The breeze blew harder, and the globe spun slowly, casting its pattern of delicate blues and greens and violets faintly on the moonlit floor. An insect buzzed loudly&#x2014;a cicada hidden in the ivy draping my window, I guessed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Tink twisted out of my arms and leapt at the globe as if he meant to knock it down. &#x201c;No!&#x201d; I shouted and gave him a light spank on his side. He hissed at me and ran under the bed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knelt down and peered at him, almost invisible in the shadows. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Tink,&#x201d; I whispered.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I was afraid you&#x2019;d break it&#x2014;and let the witch out.&#x201d; I was joking, but he growled at me, his tail twice as big as usual.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Tink!&#x201d; I reached for him, but he growled again, louder this time. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter with you? Are you afraid of that cicada?&#x201d; I reached for him again but got the same grumpy response. &#x201c;Okay, stay there. See if I care, silly old cat.&#x201d; I slid under the covers and turned out the bedside lamp. The cicada cried louder, buzzing as if it were in my room, not in the ivy outside the window. Drowsily, I watched the witch catcher turn this way and that, subject to every whim of the breeze. The glass seemed to glow with a greenish light, as if it caught moonlight as well as sunlight. A moon catcher, I thought, liking that better than witch catcher. Slowly I slid into a deep sleep full of strange dreams. In the first, I was alone in a dark forest. Tall trees loomed over me, hiding the sky. There was n...</p></p><h2>The Natural House: A Complete Guide to Healthy, Energy-Efficient, Environmental Homes</h2><p><p><em>The Natural House</em> is a tour of the construction, costs, and pros and cons of fourteen natural building methods. Straw Bale, Rammed Earth, Cob, Cordwood, Adobe, Earthbags, Papercrete, Earthships...whatever the method, the common goal is to create a house that is economical, energy efficient, nontoxic, soothing to the soul, kind to the environment, and pleasing to behold. This comprehensive sourcebook offers in-depth information that will guide your search for the perfect sustainable dream home. It is a must for home builders, contractors, and architects.</p> <p>Author Dan Chiras shows how you can gain energy independence and reduce your environmental impact through passive solar heating and cooling techniques, solar electricity, wind power, and micro-hydropower. He also explains safe, economical ways to obtain clean drinking water and treat wastewater, and discusses affordable green products.</p> <p>While he's an unabashed advocate of natural building techniques, Chiras takes care not to romanticize and to alert readers to avoidable pitfalls. His detailed, practical, and ecologically sound advice can save tens of thousands of dollars, whether you are buying, building, or renovating a natural home.</p></p><p><p>Dan Chiras paid his last electric bill in June of 1996. It is not that he has disavowed the use of electricity and modern conveniences, but rather that he has turned to the sun and wind to meet his family's needs.<br><br> In 1995, Dan, a former full-time college professor with years of experience in sustainable development, built a state-of-the-art rammed earth tire and straw bale home in Evergreen, Colorado. He installed solar electric panels on the roof; a year or so later he installed a small wind generator. Since that time, he has met nearly all of his electrical needs for his home and office from these clean, renewable sources.<br><br> Dan also heats his home in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains 8000-feet above sea level with energy from the sun thanks to passive solar design. For backup heat on those cold winter nights, he burns a cord of wood a year, gathered free from his community. His annual gas bill, mostly for showers and cooking, runs about $120 a year - about $2 to $3 per month for natural gas and $10 per month to read the meter!<br><br> Dan has spent much of the past 30 years studying sustainability and applying what he has learned in solar energy, natural building, and green building to his residences, and most of the last ten years sharing the practical knowledge he has gained through writing, lectures, slide shows, and workshops.<br><br> Dan has published 21 books to date including several college and high school textbooks: <em>Environmental Science: Creating a Sustainable Future, Natural Resource Conservation, Human Biology</em>, and <em>Biology: The Web of Life</em>. His high school environmental science text, <em>Environmental Science</em>, was selected as the official book of the U.S. Academic Decathlon's 1991 competition.<br><br> In the early 1990s, Dan published two trade books on environmental issues and sustainability for a general audience: <em>Beyond the Fray: Reshaping America's Response</em> and <em>Lessons from Nature: Learning to Live Sustainably on the Earth</em>.<br><br> Since 1995, Dan has focused most of his attention on residential green building. He has written extensively on the subject. His is books include: <em>The Natural House: A Complete Guide to Healthy, Energy Efficient, Environmental Homes; The Natural Plaster Book; The Solar House: Passive Heating and Cooling; Superbia! 31 Ways to Create Sustainable Suburbs</em>; and <em>The New Ecological Home</em>.<br><br> His newest book, <em>EcoKids: Raising Kids Who Care for the Earth</em> will be published in the Spring of 2005 by New Society Publishers.<br><br> Dan also writes extensively for magazines, journals, newsletters, and newspapers. He has published nearly 250 articles on environmental issues, sustainability, natural building, natural plaster, green building, and passive solar heating and cooling. His articles appear regularly in <em>Home Power, Mother Earth News, Natural Home</em>, and <em>The Last Straw</em>.<br><br> Dan also writes frequently for <em>World Book Encyclopedia</em> (Science Year) and <em>Encyclopedia Americana</em>. He authored a 12-page article on the environment for <em>Encyclopedia Americana</em>. Dan has written environmental pollution section for <em>World Book Encyclopedia's</em> annual publication, <em>Science Year</em>, since 1993. In 1997, he wrote an extensive piece for <em>World Book</em> on population growth and its many implications. Dan also wrote the ecology and air pollution sections for <em>Encyclopedia Americana</em>.<br><br> In addition to his writing, Dan has served as an adjunct professor at the University of Colorado in Denver and the University of Colorado at Denver. He has been a visiting professor at the University of Washington, where he taught a course on environmental science. He currently is a Melon Visiting Professor at Colorado College where he teaches courses on renewable energy, ecological design, and sustainable development.<br><br> Through his writing and teaching in the 1980s and early 1990s, Dan played a leading role in promoting critical thinking, an understanding of the root causes of environmental issues, systemic solutions to environmental problems, sustainable development. He pioneered a systems approach to sustainable development and has played a lead role in articulating the principles, policies, and practices of sustainable development which seeks ways that business and society can prosper within a healthy environment.

As you proceed, you will find that many so-called experts will express divergent views on various issues--for example, whether it makes sense to place rigid foam under a concrete slab. People just plain differ in their views. Always seek competent advice and be wary of those who can't back up their assertions with hard facts. If you feel in your guts that something isn't right, trust your intuition. Some misinformation comes from proponents of particular homes, who often promote "their technology" as if it were the ultimate in homebuilding. Well meaning and vital to the advancement of natural homebuilding, these pioneers sometimes suffer from a bit of zealousness that we must accept, understand, and lovingly forgive. </p><p>Beware of rosy construction cost estimates, too. Tim Pettet, an Earthship, straw bale, and adobe builder based in Ouray, Colorado, makes a living largely helping people who have gotten into trouble, either financially or technically, while building a natural home of their own. Many of his clients, he says, have read an article or two in a popular magazine or newspaper about people who have built Earthships for some ridiculously low price, then set out to replicate the experience. Sadly, many of them find that they can't build the home of their dreams for $40 per square foot. Others run into difficulty, being swayed by wrongful assertions that it is "easy to build a natural home." Low on money or in over their heads, they call Tim to bail them out. (Tim is listed in the resource guide.) If you are building your own home, hire a consultant early on, before you start construction. As Cedar Rose, a consultant and natural builder from Carbondale, Colorado asserts, "People get into trouble because they don't spend enough time planning. A few thousand dollars spent on planning can save you tens of thousands of dollars in the long run." </p><p>From Chapter 6: Should You Build with Cob? By now, you are aware that each form of natural building has its list of pros and cons. Let me hasten to add that disadvantages are not unique to alternative building. Conventional homebuilding has disadvantages, too. But because we are so familiar with conventional techniques, we forget the disadvantages, among them, their egregious depletion of the Earth's natural resources. So, don't damn alternative building for a few faults until you've compared it to conventional practices. </p><p>Advantages of Building with Cob </p><p>* Building with earth can be fun and relatively inexpensive, especially if you do the work yourself, scrounge for materials, build a simple structure, and have modest desires when it comes to finish materials. * Cob structures lend themselves to curved walls and other visually inviting features. It is easy and fun to fashion niches, furniture, and shelves out of cob. * Cob construction encourages artistic expression. Walls can be designed as they go up, providing maximum creative freedom. A cob home can be as much art as it is a home. * Rounded, tapered walls appear to be highly resistant to earthquakes. * Cob construction does not require forms as in rammed earth construction. * Cob is applied directly to the wall, eliminating the need to make mud bricks, as in adobe construction. * Cob homes are ideally suited for passive solar heating. * In some areas, such as arid desert regions, cob stays warm in the winter and cool in the summer. * Thick cob walls insulate the interior space from outside noise. * Cob construction relies on locally available resources. * Cob construction requires much less wood and fewer manufactured building materials than many other forms of building. * Cob construction is relatively easy to learn and requires minimal building skills. Even kids can become skilled cobbers. * Cob construction is labor intensive, but requires very little outside energy or power tools. * Cob construction is forgiving. Mistakes can be easily rectified. * Cob integrates well with other earth-friendly forms of architecture, including straw bale and adobe. * Cob is easy to remodel, even when fully cured. For example, windows can be added and walls can be extended to create new living space. * Cob can be used to fashion niches, furniture, and shelves. * Cob walls are fireproof. * Building with cob poses little danger to workers on the site. * Cob construction encourages community participation. Young and old, family and friends, can participate in meaningful ways. </p><p>What Are the Disadvantages? </p><p>* Getting approval for cob construction may be difficult in some areas. In the U.S., there are only a few jurisdictions that formally approve cob construction. Many cob builders therefore choose to avoid building departments. Although this is an option, it is a risky one. If you are caught, a building department can force you to tear down an unpermitted structure. Note: Some legally permitted cob buildings are now starting to appear. These may make it easier in the future for others to follow suit. * Cob construction, while relatively simple, is labor intensive. That can be a plus or a minus, depending on your personality and your attitudes about the value of hard work. * Stone foundations, which are often used in cob construction, are also labor intensive. A small, 20-foot round building will require 8 tons of stone, which are usually collected by hand, stockpiled, and then set in place. * Cob is a remarkable housing alternative. To many people, its benefits clearly outweigh its negatives. But earth-friendly architecture is only half of the battle to living lightly on the land. To be sustainable, the home should incorporate passive solar design, solar electricity, recycled materials, rain catchment, graywater recycling, and other features discussed in Part 3.</p></p><h2>Sunset Song (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>The achingly beautiful Scottish novel now adapted as an acclaimed feature film directed by Terence Davies (<i>The House of Mirth</i>, <i>The Deep Blue Sea</i>)</b><br><br>Young Chris Guthrie lives a brutal life in the harsh landscape of northern Scotland, torn between her passion for the land, duty to her family and her love of books.

Thomas Fleming tells this story through the complex figure of Woodrow Wilson, the contradictory president who wept after declaring war, devastated because he knew it would destroy the tolerance of the American people, but who then suppressed freedom of speech and used propaganda to excite America into a Hun-hating mob. This is tragic history: inexperienced American military leaders drove their troops into gruesome slaughters; progressive politics were put on hold in America; an idealistic president&#39;s dreams were crushed because of his own negligence. Wilson&#39;s inability to convince Congress to ratify U.S. membership in the League of Nations was one of the most poignant failures in the history of the American presidency, but even more heartrending were Wilson&#39;s concessions to his bitter allies in the Treaty of Versailles. In exchange for Allied support of the League of Nations, he allowed an unfair peace treaty to be signed, a treaty that played no small role in the rise of National Socialism and the outbreak of World War II. Thomas Fleming has once again created a masterpiece of narrative American history. This incomparable portrait shows how Wilson sacrificed his noble vision to megalomania and single-mindedness, while paying homage to him as a visionary whose honorable spirit continues to influence Western politics.</p><p><b>Thomas Fleming</b> is the author of more than forty books, including <i>The New Dealers' War, Duel</i> , and <i>Liberty!

The political history of the American experience in World War I is a story of conflict and bungled intentions that begins in an era dedicated to progressive social reform and ends in the Red Scare and Prohibition. Thomas Fleming tells this story through the complex figure of Woodrow Wilson, the contradictory president who wept after declaring war, devastated because he knew it would destroy the tolerance of the American people, but who then suppressed freedom of speech and used propaganda to excite America into a Hun-hating mob. This is tragic history: inexperienced American military leaders drove their troops into gruesome slaughters; progressive politics were put on hold in America; an idealistic president's dreams were crushed because of his own negligence. Wilson's inability to convince Congress to ratify US membership in the League of Nations was one of the most poignant failures in the history of the American presidency, but even more heartrending were Wilson's concessions to his bitter allies in the Treaty of Versailles. In exchange for Allied support of the League of Nations, he allowed an unfair peace treaty to be signed, a treaty that played no small role in the rise of National Socialism and the outbreak of World War II. Thomas Fleming has once again created a masterpiece of narrative American history. This incomparable portrait shows how Wilson sacrificed his noble vision to megalomania and single-mindedness, while paying homage to him as a visionary whose honorable spirit continues to influence Western politics. --Larry Petersen<br><br>In this sweeping historical canvas, Thomas Fleming undertakes nothing less than a drastic revision of our experience in World War I. He reveals how the British and French duped Wilson into thinking the war was as good as won, and there would be no need to send an army overseas. He describes a harried president making speech after speech proclaiming America's ideals while supporting espionage and sedition acts that sent critics to federal prisons. And he gives a harrowing account of how the Allies did their utmost to turn the American Expeditionary Force into cannon fodder on the Western Front.Thoroughly researched and dramatically told, The Illusion of Victory offers compelling testimony to the power of a president's visionary ideals-as well as a starkly cautionary tale about the dangers of applying them in a war-maddened world. --David Kirk</p><h2>The Fiery Heart: A Bloodlines Novel</h2><p><i>Sydney Sage is an Alchemist, one of a group of humans who dabble in magic and serve to bridge the worlds of humans and vampires.

Walking into a room and seeing your girlfriend reading a baby-name book can kind of make your heart stop.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m no expert,&#x201d; I began, choosing my words carefully. &#x201c;Well&#x2014;actually, I am. And I&#x2019;m pretty sure there are certain things we have to do before you need to be reading that.&#x201d;</p><p>Sydney Sage, the aforementioned girlfriend and light of my life, didn&#x2019;t even look up, though a hint of a smile played at her lips. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s for the initiation,&#x201d; she said matter-of-factly, as though she were talking about getting her nails done or picking up groceries instead of joining a coven of witches. &#x201c;I have to have a &#x2018;magical&#x2019; name they use during their gatherings.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right. Magical name, initiation. Just another day in the life, huh?&#x201d; Not that I was one to talk, seeing as I was a vampire with the fantastic yet complicated abilities to heal and compel people.</p><p>This time, I got a full smile, and she lifted her gaze. Afternoon sunlight filtering through my bedroom window caught her eyes and brought out the amber glints within them. They widened in surprise when she noticed the three stacked boxes I was carrying. &#x201c;What are those?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A revolution in music,&#x201d; I declared, reverently setting them on the floor. I opened the top one and unveiled a record player. &#x201c;I saw a sign that some guy was selling them on campus.&#x201d; I opened a box full of records and lifted out <i>Rumours</i> by Fleetwood Mac. &#x201c;Now I can listen to music in its purest form.&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t look impressed; surprising for someone who thought my 1967 Mustang&#x2014;which she&#x2019;d named the Ivashkinator&#x2014;was some sort of holy shrine. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty sure digital music is as pure as it gets. That was a waste of money, Adrian. I can fit all the songs in those boxes on my phone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can you fit the other six boxes that are in my car on your phone?&#x201d;</p><p>She blinked in astonishment and then turned wary. &#x201c;Adrian, how much did you pay for all that?&#x201d;</p><p>I waved off the question. &#x201c;Hey, I can still make the car payment. Barely.&#x201d; I at least didn&#x2019;t have to pay rent, since the place was prepaid, but I had plenty of other bills. &#x201c;Besides, I&#x2019;ve got a bigger budget for this kind of stuff now that <i>someone</i> made me quit smoking and cut back on happy hour.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;More like happy day,&#x201d; she said archly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking out for your health.&#x201d;</p><p>I sat down beside her on the bed. &#x201c;Just like I&#x2019;m looking out for you and your caffeine addiction.&#x201d; It was a deal we&#x2019;d made, forming our own sort of support group. I&#x2019;d quit smoking and cut back to one drink a day. She&#x2019;d ousted her obsessive dieting for a healthy number of calories and was down to only one cup of coffee a day. Surprisingly, she&#x2019;d had a harder time with that than I&#x2019;d had with alcohol. In those first few days, I thought I&#x2019;d have to check her into caffeine rehab.</p><p>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t an addiction,&#x201d; she grumbled, still bitter. &#x201c;More of a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. lifestyle choice.&#x201d;</p><p>I laughed and drew her face to mine in a kiss, and just like that, the rest of the world vanished. There were no name books, no records, no habits. There was just her and the feel of her lips, the exquisite way they managed to be soft and fierce at the same time. The rest of the world thought she was stiff and cold. Only I knew the truth about the passion and hunger that was locked up within her&#x2014;well, me and Jill, the girl who could see inside my mind because of a psychic bond we shared.</p><p>As I laid Sydney back on the bed, I had that faint, fleeting thought I always had, of how taboo what we were doing was. Humans and Moroi vampires had stopped intermingling when my race hid from the world in the Dark Ages. We&#x2019;d done it for safety, deciding it was best if humans didn&#x2019;t know of our existence. Now, my people and hers (the ones who knew about Moroi) considered relationships like this wrong and, among some circles, dark and twisted. But I didn&#x2019;t care. I didn&#x2019;t care about anything except her and the way touching her drove me wild, even as her calm and steady presence soothed the storms that raged within me.</p><p>That didn&#x2019;t mean we flaunted this, though. In fact, our romance was a tightly guarded secret, one that required a lot of sneaking around and carefully calculated planning. Even now, the clock was ticking. This was our weekday pattern. She had an independent study for her last period of the day at school, one managed by a lenient teacher who let her take off early and race over here. We&#x2019;d get one precious hour of making out or talking&#x2014;usually making out, made more frantic by the pressure bearing down on us&#x2014;and then she was back to her private school, just as her clingy and vampire-hating sister Zoe got out of class.</p><p>Somehow, Sydney had an internal clock that told her when time was up. I think it was part of her inherent ability to keep track of a hundred things at once. Not me. In these moments, my thoughts were usually focused on getting her shirt off and whether I&#x2019;d get past the bra this time. So far, I hadn&#x2019;t.</p><p>She sat up, cheeks flushed and golden hair tousled. She was so beautiful that it made my soul ache. I always wished desperately that I could paint her in these moments and immortalize that look in her eyes. There was a softness in them that I rarely saw at other times, a total and complete vulnerability in someone who was normally so guarded and analytical in the rest of her life. But although I was a decent painter, capturing her on canvas was beyond my skill.</p><p>She collected her brown blouse and buttoned it up, hiding the brightness of turquoise lace with the conservative attire she liked to armor herself in. She&#x2019;d done an overhaul of her bras in the last month, and though I was always sad to see them disappear, it made me happy to know they were there, those secret spots of color in her life.</p><p>As she walked over to the mirror at my dresser, I summoned some of the spirit magic within me to get a glimpse of her aura, the energy that surrounded all living things. The magic brought a brief surge of pleasure inside me, and then I saw it, that shining light around her. It was its typical self, a scholar&#x2019;s yellow balanced with the richer purple of passion and spirituality. A blink of the eye, and her aura faded away, as did the deadly exhilaration of spirit.</p><p>She finished smoothing her hair and looked down. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hmm?&#x201d; I came to stand behind her and wrapped my arms around her waist. Then, I saw what she&#x2019;d picked up and stiffened: sparkling cuff links set with rubies and diamonds. And just like that, the warmth and joy I&#x2019;d just felt were replaced by a cold but familiar darkness. &#x201c;They were a birthday present from Aunt Tatiana a few years ago.&#x201d;</p><p>Sydney held one up and studied it with an expert eye. She grinned. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got a fortune here. This is platinum. Sell these and you&#x2019;d have allowance for life. And all the records you want.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d sleep in a cardboard box before I sold those.&#x201d;</p><p>She noticed the change in me and turned around, her expression filled with concern. &#x201c;Hey, I was just joking.&#x201d; Her hand gently touched my face. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay. Everything&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;</p><p>But it wasn&#x2019;t okay. The world was suddenly a cruel, hopeless place, empty with the loss of my aunt, queen of the Moroi and the only relative who hadn&#x2019;t judged me. I felt a lump in my throat, and the walls seemed to close in on me as I remembered the way she&#x2019;d been stabbed to death and how they&#x2019;d paraded those bloody pictures around when trying to find her killer. It didn&#x2019;t matter that the killer was locked away and slated for execution. It wouldn&#x2019;t bring Aunt Tatiana back. She was gone, off to places I couldn&#x2019;t follow&#x2014;at least not yet&#x2014;and I was here, alone and insignificant and floundering.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;Adrian.&#x201d;</p><p>Sydney&#x2019;s voice was calm but firm, and slowly, I dredged myself out of the despair that could come on so quickly and heavily, a darkness that had increased over the years the more I used spirit. It was the price for that kind of power, and these sudden shifts had become more and more frequent recently. I focused on her eyes, and the light returned to the world. I still ached for my aunt, but Sydney was here, my hope and my anchor. I wasn&#x2019;t alone. I wasn&#x2019;t misunderstood. Swallowing, I nodded and gave her a weak smile as spirit&#x2019;s dark hand released its hold on me. For now.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay.&#x201d; Seeing the doubt in her face, I pressed a kiss to her forehead. &#x201c;Really. You need to go, Sage. You&#x2019;ll make Zoe wonder, and you&#x2019;ll be late for your witch meeting.&#x201d;</p><p>She stared at me with concern a few moments longer and then relaxed a little. &#x201c;Okay. But if you need anything&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know, I know. Call on the Love Phone.&#x201d;</p><p>That brought her smile back. We&#x2019;d recently acquired secret prepaid cell phones that the Alchemists, the organization she worked for, wouldn&#x2019;t be able to track. Not that they regularly tracked her main phone&#x2014;but they certainly could if they thought something suspicious was happening, and we didn&#x2019;t want a trail of texts and calls.</p><p>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;ll come by tonight,&#x201d; I added.</p><p>At that, her features hardened again. &#x201c;Adrian, no. It&#x2019;s too risky.&#x201d;</p><p>Another of spirit&#x2019;s benefits was the ability to visit people in their dreams. It was a handy way to talk since we didn&#x2019;t have a lot of time together in the waking world&#x2014;and because we didn&#x2019;t spend much time talking in the waking world these days&#x2014;but like any use of spirit, it was a continual risk to my sanity. It worried her a lot, but I considered it a small thing in order to be with her.</p><p>&#x201c;No arguments,&#x201d; I warned. &#x201c;I want to know how things go. And I know you&#x2019;ll want to know how things go for me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Adrian&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll keep it short,&#x201d; I promised.</p><p>She reluctantly agreed&#x2014;not looking happy at all&#x2014;and I walked her out to the door. As we cut through the living room, she paused at a small terrarium sitting near the window. Smiling, she knelt down and tapped the glass. Inside was a dragon.</p><p>No, really. Technically, it was called a callistana, but we rarely used that term. We usually called him Hopper. Sydney had summoned him from some demonic realm as a sort of helper. Mostly he seemed to want to help us out by eating all the junk food in my apartment. She and I were tied to him, and to maintain his health, we had to take turns hanging out with him. Since Zoe had moved in, however, my place had become his primary residence. Sydney lifted the lid of the tank and let the small golden-scaled creature scurry into her hand. He gazed up at her adoringly, and I couldn&#x2019;t blame him for that.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s been out for a while,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You ready to take a break?&#x201d; Hopper could exist in this living form or be transformed into a small statue, which helped avoid uncomfortable questions when people came by. Only she could transform him, though.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. He keeps trying to eat my paints. And I don&#x2019;t want him to watch me kiss you goodbye.&#x201d;</p><p>She gave him a light tickle on the chin and spoke the words that turned him into a statue. Life was certainly easier that way, but again, his health required he come out now and then. That, and the little guy <i>had</i> grown on me.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take him for a while,&#x201d; she said, slipping him into her purse. Even if he was inert, he still benefited from being near her.</p><p>Free of his beady little gaze, I gave her a long kiss goodbye, one I was reluctant to let end. I cupped her face in my hands.</p><p>&#x201c;Escape plan number seventeen,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;Run away and open a juice stand in Fresno.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why Fresno?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds like the kind of place people drink a lot of juice.&#x201d;</p><p>She grinned and kissed me again. The &#x201c;escape plans&#x201d; were a running joke with us, always far-fetched and numbered in no particular order. I usually made them up on the spot. What was sad, though, was that they were actually more thought out than any real plans we had. Both of us were painfully aware that we were very much living in the now, with a future that was anything but clear.</p><p>Breaking that second kiss was difficult too, but she finally managed it, and I watched her walk away. My apartment seemed dimmer in her absence.</p><p>I brought in the rest of the boxes from my car and sifted through the treasures within. Most of the albums were from the sixties and seventies, with a little eighties here and there. They weren&#x2019;t organized, but I didn&#x2019;t make any attempts at that. Once Sydney got over her stance that they were a wasteful splurge, she wouldn&#x2019;t be able to help herself and would end up sorting them all by artist or genre or color. For now, I set up the record player in my living room and pulled out an album at random: <i>Machine Head</i> by Deep Purple.</p><p>I had a few more hours until dinner, so I crouched down in front of an easel, staring up at the blank canvas as I tried to decide how to deal with my current assignment in advanced oil painting: a self-portrait. It didn&#x2019;t have to be an exact likeness. It could be abstract. It could be anything, so long as it was representative of me. And I was stumped. I could&#x2019;ve painted anyone else I knew. Maybe I couldn&#x2019;t capture that exact look of rapture Sydney had in my arms, but I could paint her aura or the color of her eyes. I could have painted the wistful, fragile face of my friend Jill Mastrano Dragomir, a young princess of the Moroi. I could have painted flaming roses in tribute to my ex-girlfriend, who&#x2019;d torn my heart apart yet still managed to make me admire her.</p><p>But myself? I didn&#x2019;t know what to do for me. Maybe it was just an artistic block. Maybe I didn&#x2019;t know myself. As I stared at the canvas, my frustration growing, I had to fight off the need to go to my neglected liquor cupboard and pour a drink. Alcohol didn&#x2019;t necessarily make for the best art, but it usually inspired something. I could practically taste the vodka already. I could mix it with orange juice and pretend I was being healthy. My fingers twitched, and my feet nearly carried me to the kitchen&#x2014;but I resisted. The earnestness in Sydney&#x2019;s eyes burned through my mind, and I focused back on the canvas. I could do this&#x2014;sober. I&#x2019;d promised her I&#x2019;d have only one drink a day, and I&#x2019;d hold true to that. And for the time being, that one drink was needed for the end of the day, when I was ready for bed. I didn&#x2019;t sleep well. I never had in my entire life, so I had to use whatever help I could get.</p><p>My sober resolve didn&#x2019;t result in inspiration, though, and when five o&#x2019;clock came around, the canvas remained bare. I stood up and stretched out the kinks in my body, feeling a return of that earlier darkness. It was more angry than sad, laced with the frustration of not being able to do this. My art teachers claimed I had talent, but in moments like this, I felt like the slacker most people had always said I was, destined for a lifetime of failure. It was especially depressing when I thought about Sydney, who knew everything about everything and could excel at any career she wanted. Putting aside the vampire-human problem, I had to wonder what I could possibly offer her. I couldn&#x2019;t even pronounce half the things that interested her, let alone discuss them. If we ever managed some normal life together, she&#x2019;d be out paying the bills while I stayed home and cleaned. And I really wasn&#x2019;t good at that either. If she just wanted to come home at night to eye candy with good hair, I could probably be that reasonably well.</p><p>I knew these fears eating at me were...</p></p><h2>Good Strategy/Bad Strategy: The difference and why it matters [Paperback] [Feb 01, 2013] Richard Rumelt</h2><p>Good Strategy/Bad Strategy clarifies the muddled thinking underlying too many strategies and provides a clear way to create and implement a powerful action-oriented strategy for the real world.

Until January 2003, Kiechel served as editorial director of HBP and senior vice president in charge of its publishing division, with responsibility for the <em>Harvard Business Review</em>; HBS Press, the company's book-publishing arm; the newsletter unit (which he helped start in 1996) as well as HBP&#x2019;s video, reprints, and conference businesses</strong> <br> <p> </p> <p>Considering the source, this is a shocking book. For over 40 years Richard Rumelt has made distinguished contributions to the field of strategy, in his theorizing, teaching, and consulting. Now comes the deponent to tell us that what purports to be strategy at most organizations, not just companies but not-for-profits and governments as well, hardly merits the name. Instead it represents what he calls "bad strategy"--a list of blue-sky goals, perhaps, or a fluff-and-buzzword infected "vision" everybody is supposed to share.</p> <p>Refreshing stuff this, seeing the corporate emperor revealed not in his imagined suit of armor but rather in something resembling a diaphanous clown suit. Rumelt drives the point home with a simple explanation for why most organizations can't do "good strategy": the real McCoy requires making choices, feeding a few promising beasties while goring the oxen of others at the management table. </p> <p>But the jeremiad, fun as it is--and it is fun, Rumelt has a good time punching holes in the afflatus of bad strategy--isn't my favorite part of the book. That would be the second section, with the slightly daunting title "Sources of Power." To be useful to a practitioner, a book on strategy needs not only a straightforward framework but also a certain craftiness, a set of ideas that prompt the reader to think "What a neat idea" or "How clever of them." Rumelt has the clear, elegant framework in what he calls the "kernel"--a diagnosis explaining the nature of the challenge, a guiding policy for dealing with it, coherent actions for carrying out the policy. </p> <p>In "Sources of Power," though, he goes deeper than the merely crafty to identify potential levers of for strategic advantage--proximate objectives, design, and focus, among others--that transcend the purely economic. Repeatedly he demonstrates how to think down through the apparent challenge, with questions and then questions of those questions, to get at what can be the bedrock of a good strategy. </p> <p>In a final section on thinking like a strategist, we get a sense of what a delight it must be to sit in Rumelt's classroom, or with him on a consulting assignment, as he leads us through the best kind of Socratic dialogue to appreciate the kinds of blinders or mass psychology that can pose the final barriers to our forging clear-eyed strategy. </p> <p>If you want to make strategy, or be an informed part of the ever-evolving conversation around the subject, you will need to read this book. My bet is that you'll enjoy the experience. <em>--Walter Kiechel</em></p><b>RICHARD P.

All the major European powers apart from Russia were heavily involved and, while each country started out with rational war aims, the fighting rapidly spiralled out of control, with great battles giving way to marauding bands of starving soldiers spreading plague and murder. The war was both a religious and a political one and it was this tangle of motives that made it impossible to stop. Whether motivated by idealism or cynicism, everyone drawn into the conflict was destroyed by it. At its end a recognizably modern Europe had been created but at a terrible price. Peter Wilson&#39;s book is a major work, the first new history of the war in a generation, and a fascinating, brilliantly written attempt to explain a compelling series of events. Wilson&#39;s great strength is in allowing the reader to understand the tragedy of mixed motives that allowed rulers to gamble their countries&#39; future with such horrifying results. The principal actors in the drama (Wallenstein, Ferdinand II, Gustavus Adolphus, Richelieu) are all here, but so is the experience of the ordinary soldiers and civilians, desperately trying to stay alive under impossible circumstances.</p><p>Peter Wilson is the GF Grant Professor of History at the University of Hull and the author of books on Germany and on the Holy Roman Empire.Succeeds brilliantly ...

Bruen lives in Galway, Ireland.<p>Chapter OneBrant was on his third whisky, knocking it back like a good un. He was feeling real bad, Ed McBain was dead, and nothing could ease the loss he felt. He muttered:&#x2018;Fuck.&#x2019;The barman, highly attentive to Brant&#x2019;s needs, asked:&#x2018;Yes?&#x2019;Brant gave him the granite eyes, said:&#x2018;I want something, you&#x2019;ll know.&#x2019;Brant&#x2019;s rep was legendary. In South-East London, he was feared by cops and villains alike. Numerous attempts had been made by the brass to get rid of him, but he had survived every effort.London was in a state of high alert. Since the terrorist attacks, an air of paranoia ruled. It wasn&#x2019;t that the populace wondered if the bombers would strike again, but a question of where and when.The only hero Brant had ever had was McBain, and he&#x2019;d collected all the novels. He had the latest one. Alas, now the final one, and he couldn&#x2019;t bring himself to read it. He was about to shout another drink when he heard:&#x2018;Sergeant?&#x2019;He turned to see Porter Nash, the recently promoted Porter Nash, dressed in a very flash suit. Porter was the only openly gay cop on the squad and was probably their best investigator. Brant, who hated everyone, had an unlikely friendship with him. Neither of them could quite figure out why they enjoyed each other&#x2019;s company, but fuck, go figure, they just went with it. Brant said:&#x2018;Some suit.&#x2019; Porter took the stool beside Brant, asked:&#x2018;You like it?&#x2019;Brant signalled for the barman, took a long look at the suit, said:&#x2018;It helps if you&#x2019;re gay.&#x2019;Porter laughed, most times it was the only way to go. You had dealings with Brant, you needed a great sense of humour or a sawn-off. Brant ordered two large whiskies and Porter protested:&#x2018;I wanted some vodka.&#x2019;Brant blew it off, said:&#x2018;With lime, I suppose. Have a real drink for once.&#x2019;The barman knew Brant, of course, everybody knew him, but the other geezer, he was new and very worrying. He had manners, said thank you when he plonked the drinks down, so he couldn&#x2019;t be a cop. But he had a look, despite the nancy suit, he had a way of holding himself, that was... not to be fucked with. The barman would keep an eye, see what he could discover.Brant clinked his glass against Porter&#x2019;s, said:&#x2018;I think the bar guy fancies you.&#x2019;Porter took a quick glance, said:&#x2018;Not my type.&#x2019;Brant knocked back a lethal gulp, Porter sipped at his then, seeing Brant&#x2019;s expression, took a larger sip, said:&#x2018;Could I get some water for this?&#x2019;Brant was lighting a cig. He&#x2019;d switched to a so-called low-tar brand, it wasn&#x2019;t doing it. Porter, six months without smoking, inhaled the smoke greedily, resigned himself to the neat whisky, asked:&#x2018;So what do you think of the Yank?&#x2019;Brant looked at his watch and, if he&#x2019;d only known, he had maybe ten minutes before he was shot.The Yank was L. M. Wallace, a terrorist expert. All the squads had been assigned one, the reasoning being that they knew when and where an attack might happen. As the Americans spoke of 9/11, the Brits, alas, now had 21/7. Brant stubbed out the cig, said:&#x2018;Haven&#x2019;t met him yet.&#x2019;His tone suggested he could give a fuck, but he asked:&#x2018;You met him?&#x2019;Porter nodded. He&#x2019;d been assigned as mentor, guide, nanny, what the fuck ever, mainly to ensure the guy was made welcome. He said:&#x2018;He&#x2019;s big, I&#x2019;ll give him that.&#x2019;Brant laughed, his special filthy one that had no relation to humour, and he said:&#x2018;Hung, eh?&#x2019;Porter finished the drink and felt the warmth caress his stomach, the artificial ease. He&#x2019;d take any relief he got, said:&#x2018;The guy is about fourteen stone and has a face that looks like someone blasted him with a blowtorch, and his credentials, impressive, I&#x2019;ve got to admit.&#x2019;Nothing, nothing in the world impressed Brant. He asked:&#x2018;Impress me.&#x2019;The shooter entered the bar, the Browning Automatic in his jacket. He had racked the slide a moment before and was, so to speak, cocked. He saw the two cops at the bar. Got his stance in gear.Porter said:&#x2018;FBI Anti-Terrorist Squad, Special Ops, Homeland Security, and a whole batch of citations.&#x2019;Brant digested this and was about to make a smart-ass reply.The shooter had the Browning out. He was about to squeeze the trigger when a woman pushed open the door, knocking him slightly off balance. He muttered:&#x2018;Fuck.&#x2019;Tried to regain his balance, pulling on the trigger. Released a barrage of shots. Bottles exploded behind the counter, pieces of the counter flew in the air, and Porter pushed Brant to the floor, covering his body with his own. The gunman, seeing the cops down, hoped to fuck he&#x2019;d hit something and legged it. People were screaming, a drunk, sozzled in the corner, came out of his stupor, asked:&#x2018;Is it Christmas?&#x2019;Porter was on his radio, screaming:&#x2018;Shooting, gunman heading from the King&#x2019;s Arms on the Kennington Road.&#x2019; He stood up, the smell of cordite, mixed with the spilled booze, was heady. He looked down. Brant wasn&#x2019;t moving and Porter bent, put out his arm, saw the hole in Brant&#x2019;s back, he screamed:&#x2018;Get a fucking ambulance.&#x2019;To his radio, he shouted:&#x2018;Officer down, repeat, officer down.&#x2019;The drunk began to hum &#x2018;Jingle Bells.&#x2019;Ammunition.

What she doesn't expect is that she will be responsible for the future survival of Xanth itself.<br>For a peril of immense gravity endangers the enchanted land of Xanth. Or, rather, a lack of gravity. The Demon Earth, who rules our own world, has suddenly and mysteriously disappeared. Without Demon Earth's vast powers, everything on the surface of the Earth and all other worlds, including Xanth, will go whirling weightlessly away into space.<br><br>By merest chance, Cynthia Centaur has come to the Good Magician's castle at precisely the wrong moment. For the Muse of History has decreed that the very next Querent who asks Humfrey a Question will be charged with the awesome responsibility of finding the Demon Earth and saving Xanth.<br><br>It's whispered that another Demon (with a capital D) has done the dastardly deed. The only weapon that can prevail against such a cosmic being is the instrument known as the Swell Foop. And the only way to handle its awesome power is to locate the Six Lost Rings of Xanth, whose whereabouts are known only to the Zombies. <br><br>So Cynthia and five companions-her beloved mate, Che; Breanna of the Black Wave and her fiancï¿½ Justin Tree; Sim, the immortal bird who will one day know all the secrets of the universe; and Jaylin, a young human girl from the Mundane land of Hawaii -embark on a quest of utmost danger, to challenge an Unknown Demon for the fate of a dozen worlds. <br>A harrowing and hilarious escapade that ranges from Earth to Xanth to a galaxy far, far away, <i>Swell Foop</i> is pure magical merriment from the prolific pen of fantasy master Piers Anthony.<br><br></p><p>Piers Anthony is one of the world&#39;s most popular fantasy authors. He lives in Inverness, Florida.<br><p>1 Question</p><p>Cynthia crested a hill and spied the Good Magician&#x2019;s castle. She paused, surveying it, her pulse accelerating with maidenly excitement. She was here; could she handle the three Challenges? She knew they would be possible but not easy.</p><p>Suddenly her Question seemed foolishly inadequate. She really didn&#x2019;t need to bother Magician Humfrey with it; there was one sure way to get the answer on her own. The trouble was, that way was dangerous. If she proved to be unlucky, she could regret it for the rest of her life. So she could not afford to gamble; she had to know before she married Che Centaur.</p><p>She spread her fair white wings and leaped into the air. She had been trotting, perhaps to give herself more time to think, but now she would fly in before she had a chance to change her timid mind again. After all, centaurs weren&#x2019;t supposed to be femalishly irresolute. They were supposed to be intelligent and decisive. She had been a centaur only half her life, or one-third of it, or five-sixths of it, depending on how she chose to see it at the moment. She was still learning.</p><p>The castle looked deceptively placid. The tower windows were open, the moat was calm, and the drawbridge was down. Just as if anyone could walk right in. Well, there was one way to make proof of that.</p><p>Cynthia Centaur glided to a four-hoof landing, folded her wings, and trotted up to the drawbridge. Sure enough, it lifted just before she got there. Unsurprised, she walked down the bank to the water. As her fore-hoof touched it, colored fins appeared. Loan sharks. She backed off; she did not want to let them take an arm or a leg. There would be no swimming today.</p><p>She spread her wings and leaped. The feathers found no purchase; she landed back on the ground. She nodded, having confirmed another limit. She could not walk, swim, or fly across the moat. It was a Challenge.</p><p>So what was the way? There had to be something likely but difficult, and she would have to figure out how to make it work. That was the way of it. The Good Magician did not like to be bothered with frivolous Questions, so he made it awkward for querents to get in to ask them. Then they had to pay a year&#x2019;s service, or the equivalent, for the Answers. Even so, there seemed to be a fairly constant stream of them. Many of them worked off their Services by becoming parts of Challenges for later comers. So it amounted to a cottage industry.</p><p>None of which helped her to cross the moat. What had Magician Humfrey cooked up for her? For the Challenges tended to relate to the abilities of the ones whose progress they barred. It would require centaur savvy to get through.</p><p>She walked around the moat, seeking some hint. All was quiet. Until she was halfway: 180ï¿½ in precise centaur terminology. There she saw a rope supported by a system of pulleys on either side of the moat. One end was attached to a small boat at the outer bank, and another end was in the hands of a lovely human woman.</p><p>"Ahoy there, centaur!" the woman cried. "Do you mean to anger?"</p><p>"Why, no," Cynthia said, surprised. "Am I somehow giving offense?"</p><p>"Frustrate, interfere, balk, thwart, oppose&#x2014;"</p><p>"Cross?"</p><p>"Whatever," the woman replied crossly. "Do you intend to navigate this moat?"</p><p>"Why, hello, Demoness Metria!" Cynthia said. "Are you operating this Challenge?"</p><p>"Yes, I&#x2019;m stuck here until I help someone get across. If you want to come in, get in the boat and I&#x2019;ll haul you over."</p><p>"But I weigh a lot more than you do," Cynthia protested. "It would be difficult for you to pull me."</p><p>"That&#x2019;s why I have the pulley. It gives me the magic of buy."</p><p>"Of what?"</p><p>"Shop, browse, patronize, bargain, purchase&#x2014;"</p><p>Cynthia fixed on the last word. "Leverage?"</p><p>"Whatever. Get in the stupid boat. I&#x2019;ll use the crastination to haul you across."</p><p>Crastination? Cynthia hesitated to inquire. It was probably the name for the fancy pulley. She wasn&#x2019;t sure about this, but nothing better offered, so she set four feet in the boat and hunkered down so as not to tip it over. This was hardly her most comfortable mode of passage, but of course the Challenges were not designed to be comfortable.</p><p>Metria pulled on her rope. It swung her halfway across the moat. Cynthia&#x2019;s boat hardly budged.</p><p>"!!" the demoness swore up, down, and sideways. The water beneath her bubbled and clouded as if abruptly heated.</p><p>"I think I&#x2019;m still too heavy for you," Cynthia said.</p><p>"You&#x2019;re not too heavy! I&#x2019;m just too amateurish. I can&#x2019;t get it right."</p><p>Obviously true. Cynthia watched as Metria swung back to her side of the moat and landed on the bank. "Maybe if you pulled it more slowly, to get more leverage?"</p><p>The demoness pulled more slowly&#x2014;and was hauled across the moat even faster. "!!" The green grass around her wilted and turned brown.</p><p>"I am not sure this is working," Cynthia said delicately. "Perhaps if I looked for some other way to get across&#x2014;"</p><p>The demoness vanished from the outer moat bank in a puff of vile smoke and reappeared at the inner bank, rope still in hand. "Absotively posilutely not! I am supposed to haul your donkey rear across this fetid pool of snot, and I shall do it if it vetoes us all." Now steam rose from the water, and chips flaked from the castle wall behind her. What little vegetation remained in the area gave up the ghost; little plant-shaped spirits were floating into the sky.</p><p>Cynthia&#x2019;s maidenly ears were hurting. She had never before seen a demon quite this enraged, and wasn&#x2019;t sure she would survive with her health if it got any worse. She decided not to argue. "Of course, Metria," she said soothingly. "It will surely work out."</p><p>"It had better moil out," the demoness gritted wrathfully, "or I might become annoyed." Thin plumes of smoke jetted from her ears, and veins stood out in stark red relief on the crackling surfaces of her eyeballs.</p><p>This was still beneath the level of annoyance? Three of Cynthia&#x2019;s knees felt weak, and the fourth was none too strong. She had to pacify Metria before she exploded, destroying the whole castle. Obviously the present approach wasn&#x2019;t working. The demoness did not seem to know how to operate the pulley correctly, but surely would not be amenable to suggestions by an outsider. How could this be handled posilutely&#x2014;oops, positively?</p><p>Maybe if she reverted to basics. "Metria, I&#x2019;m sure there&#x2019;s some mistake, and something is interfering with your effort. Maybe if we explore this from the start, we can find out what&#x2019;s happening."</p><p>"Maybe," the demoness snorted. A little smoke ring spun clear of her nose, expanding as it floated across the moat. The fin of a blue shark sliced through it&#x2014;and the fin blistered before it hastily submerged.</p><p>So far so good. "Now, I am somewhat inexperienced about demonly matters, and perhaps my vocabulary is deficient. You mentioned a crastination, which I assumed to be the pulley. Possibly I am in error." It galled her to say this, because true centaurs were seldom in error, and their vocabularies were never deficient.</p><p>Metria laughed. Waves of heat rippled outward from her; the rage was dissipating. "Maybe I misspoke. I am trying to use the pulley to keep me here while I pull you across. I am trying to crastinate, so I can stay here long enough to find out what is so infernally important about your quest."</p><p>"But there&#x2019;s nothing important about me or my quest," Cynthia said. "I just want to find out whether my offspring will breed true. You see, I&#x2019;m not a natural centaur; Magician Trent transformed me from human eighty years ago. So my children might turn out human, instead of winged centaur. I can&#x2019;t face the threat of such a horror, so I must find out before the fact."</p><p>"That&#x2019;s right; I remember now," Metria said. "You tried to fool the Magician, and he was diseased."</p><p>"He was what?"</p><p>"Instead of being at ease, he was&#x2014;"</p><p>"Oh. Not eased. Perturbed."</p><p>"Whatever," the demoness agreed crossly. "So he punished you."</p><p>"Yes. But now I like being a winged monster, and I love Che Centaur, and I want to be sure that when I marry him I&#x2019;ll be able to do my part. But however important that may be to me personally, I recognize that in the larger scheme of the cosmos, it is inconsequential. So it must be some other quest that is the one you want."</p><p>"No, you are the only querent scheduled for today, so it has to be you. Humfrey&#x2019;s in such a dither he didn&#x2019;t even notice how I&#x2019;m subbing for Demon Tension in the Challenge. I&#x2019;m the most curious of demonesses, and I&#x2019;ve just got to know what&#x2019;s so awful it can make even the Good Magician get all up in a heaval. So I have to get you into the castle, not me out of it. Until my oddity is sated."</p><p>"Your what is sated?"</p><p>"Eccentric, irregularity, peculiarity, abnormality, quirk&#x2014;"</p><p>"Curiosity?"</p><p>"Whatever! So I gather you don&#x2019;t even know what&#x2019;s so important about your Question."</p><p>"Well, it&#x2019;s important to me. But I think not to many others. Does it seem important to you?"</p><p>"No. Who cares whether your baby is a stinkweed? So it must be something else. I&#x2019;ve just got to know."</p><p>Cynthia was beginning to be just the merest suggestion of concerned. The Good Magician was dithered about her Question? It was true that if the Answer turned out to be negative, she would have to seriously consider not marrying Che, which would break both their hearts, but since when did Humfrey care about centaur hearts? She hardly rated any such concern. "I fear you will be disappointed. But I&#x2019;ll be happy to share my Answer with you, at such time as I obtain it. Then you can rest undisgruntled."</p><p>"Rest how?"</p><p>"Calm, placid, peaceful, quiet, serene, tranquil&#x2014;"</p><p>"That&#x2019;s six."</p><p>"I beg your pardon?"</p><p>"I usually give only five explications."</p><p>"Five whats?"</p><p>"Analogues, meanings, expressions, translations, identities&#x2014;"</p><p>"Synonyms?"</p><p>"Whatever. You gave six. That damages the cadence. I should have filled in the sixth."</p><p>"I apologize." Actually Cynthia remembered her giving six on more than one prior occasion, but she didn&#x2019;t care to argue the case. "I meant merely to say that you can rest easy, once you know what I learn from the Good Magician."</p><p>"Well, why didn&#x2019;t you say so?" the demoness demanded crossly.</p><p>"I fear I got distracted. Now about this crastination: I remain unclear as to its precise application. How will crastination help you?"</p><p>"By delaying my departure, so I can overhear Humfrey&#x2019;s verdict. I&#x2019;m trying to stall."</p><p>Cynthia nodded. "Perhaps the word you want is &#x2018;procrastination.&#x2019; "</p><p>"Yes! That&#x2019;s it. I couldn&#x2019;t quite get it. &#x2018;Amateur crastination&#x2019; was as close as I could come."</p><p>"And when an amateur does a job a professional should do, it can go wrong," Cynthia said.</p><p>"It can get downright bungled. I want to stand here and pull you across, using the&#x2014;" She hesitated.</p><p>"Leverage."</p><p>"Of the pulley. Instead it&#x2019;s been reversing, leaving you slow while I zoom across the moat."</p><p>"Try it again, this time thinking pro instead of amateur."</p><p>Metria pulled on the rope. This time she remained in place, and Cynthia&#x2019;s boat slid smoothly across the moat. She had figured it out.</p><p>"Remember&#x2014;you promised," the demoness said. "And souled folk keep their promises."</p><p>"I will tell you what I learn," Cynthia agreed. "Though I suspect it will disappoint you. Nothing about me or my concerns is important to Magicians or demons."</p><p>"We&#x2019;ll wash."</p><p>"We&#x2019;ll what?"</p><p>"Brine, water, pool, bay, ocean&#x2014;"</p><p>"Sea?"</p><p>"Whatever." The demoness looked cross as she faded out.</p><p>"We&#x2019;ll see," Cynthia agreed with half a smile. There was something almost amusing about the demoness&#x2019;s problem with words. Was the Good Magician really unaware of Metria&#x2019;s presence? The Challenge seemed remarkably apt for this particular individual.</p><p>She stepped out of the boat and surveyed the castle. There was a door in the wall. She tried the handle, and it turned, and the door opened.</p><p>Beyond was a spacious chamber filled with harpies. They were dancing, strutting in messy patterns. Feathers were flying, the walls were filthy, and the smell was appalling. No wonder: there was bird poop all over the floor, getting stirred up by the claws of the dancers. Cynthia stepped back, wrinkling her nose. Centaurs were natural about natural functions, but their manure was inoffensive and good for flowers. Harpy dung, in contrast, was truly nasty. It required special facilities for detoxification. To have it spread about a sealed chamber&#x2014;that was dangerous.</p><p>But this seemed to be the only way into the castle. The first Challenge had been a test of her understanding; she had found the key word and thus gotten through. This second Challenge seemed to be a test of her fortitude; how could she pass through this muck and stench without fainting?</p><p>The answer was that she couldn&#x2019;t. Cynthia had been cleanly all of her life, whether in human or centaur form. She had regularly washed or replaced her human clothes, then had to get used to going bare as a centaur. She had finally reached the point where she could trot past a group of human boys, knowing that their eyes were riveted to her bouncing breasts, and not be unduly embarrassed. After all, clothing fetishism was a human trait, not a centaur trait, and centaurs were not responsible for human hang-ups. Boys weren&#x2019;t supposed to see the sexual parts of girls, so naturally they lived to sneak peeks, and the upper foresection of a centaur was similar to that of a human person. So human boys did stare at centaur fillies, and thought they were getting away with something, but if there was embarrassment, it should be on the part of the boys. But going bare did not mean going dirty. The idea of going among these dirty birds repelled her.</p><p>Surely the Challenge could not be merely a matter of getting through filth. There must be a way to avoid it. But how? The ceiling of the chamber was not high; that was why the harpies were footing instead of flying. Cynthia could not fly through it, assuming her wings were working now. She had to walk. Her very hooves curled inward at the thought.</p><p>So how could she pass through this noisome chamber without tracking putrid gook? How could she breathe? The stuff would surely get on her wings, even when tightly folded, making them reek. The very notion was nauseating. She wanted no part of this foul ball.</p><p>Foul ball. Could this be a pun? Puns were the bane of Xanthly existence. They were everywhere, like poisonous toadstools, and of course even the toads did not muck about in their stools. Puns were the lowest form of humor in much the way buns were the lowest form of bread, and even buns had naughty connotations to make boys snicker. Puns brought worse reactions than snickering. So it was conceivable that an obscene dance might be called a foul ball. But puns were also the main avenue for changing things.</p><p>Suppose she thought of another meaning for ball? She concentrated&#x2014;and in a moment the dancers rolled into one feculent mass, a huge sphere that squeezed the limits of the chamber. But there was no way to pass it; the ball blocked the way. So that was evidently not the answer.

She became healthier than she'd been in 20 years. In Short Path, she discusses how past programming, buried emotions and unresolved issues affect our healing capacity here and now. She gives steps to get in touch with trapped emotions and patterns, and 30 short, easy exercises to transcend them. The chapters are organized in a natural progression from Getting Rid of Old Stuff, through assessing our influences, pushing past worry, changing self talk, shifting attention and moving past roles. The intro to the chakra system contains simple yet powerful exercises for discovering, journeying through and balancing each chakra. This is an excellent primer in discovering new ways of thought to improve your experience in this body in this lifetime. Headings include Meditation, Letting Go And Receiving, Energy Healing, and give exercises to tune into your energy body and use it to heal yourself.

Carl Gottlieb is a screenwriter credited on both JAWS and THE JERK; their association dates back to the 1960&#39;s.Crosby, founder of the 1960s rock group the Byrds and, later, leader of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, tells in excruciating detail the story of his rise to fame and subsequent depraved life as a slave to drugs. His fast-paced narrative is punctuated by the explanatory text of his long-time friend, screen writer, director and actor, Carl Gottlieb, as well as by the recollections of other friends, lovers and associates. In a milieu dominated by rock'n'roll, sex and drugs, Crosby descended to a hell of addiction that ended only after his arrest on gun and narcotics charges and forced detoxification in a Texas jail. Now drug-free for over two years, Crosby is able to write candidly about his 14 years of addiction, seemingly sparing us none of the horrors. It is a harrowing tale.

Berta Weissberger, twelve years old, lives in Hindenburg, Germany, with her mother and older sister. Her father has already left for America, and the family is awaiting the arrival of their American visas. <p>These hopes and plans are destroyed at the end of October 1938, however, when Jews are rounded up, loaded onto trucks, and driven to the Polish border. They are forced to cross a river into Poland and ordered, "Keep walking and do not turn back. Anyone attempting to turn back will be shot." </p><p>So begins Bertel's six-year terrifying odyssey in Nazi-occupied Poland. While living a life of constant vigilance and fear, Bertel grows into womanhood. Again and again, Providence steps in and saves her, guiding her to the right person or place. </p><p>It is Betty Lauer's abiding faith in a higher power that enabled her to survive while hiding in plain sight, during the dark night of Nazi Germany, and to tell this remarkable story of great evil and of the nobility of the few who dared to defy the evildoers. An extraordinary story of strength, resilience, hope, and salvation.</p></p><p>Betty Lauer was born in Hindenburg, Germany, on March 1, 1926, the younger daughter of Oskar and Ilona Weissberger. Her father left for the United States in March 1938. On October 28, 1938, she and her mother and sister for forcibly expelled from Germany to Poland. At the onset of the Blitzkrieg invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, Lauer was living in Krakow. She and her family subsequently moved to Krosno, where they remained until the liquidation of the ghetto. They escaped, and Lauer survived the Nazi occupation under an assumed name and falsified documents. She was liberated by the Russian Army in Katowicz, Poland, in February 1945.Even if you think you've read enough about the Holocaust, start this extraordinary eyewitness account, and you won't quit till you're finished. Bertel Weissberger (now Betty Lauer) was 12 in April 1938 when her father was expelled from Germany and went to America. That October, Bertel; her sister, Eva; and her mother&#x2014;along with truckloads of other German Jews&#x2014;were sent to Poland. Initially, they lived as registered Jews, with special curfews, work assignments and food rations. Then came armbands, herding into ghettos and the "liquidations" of ghettos by mass executions or transports to concentration camps. Bertel and her mother&#x2014;the Nazis caught Eva&#x2014;got forged papers and learned to pass as Polish Christians. This was a constant strain, as IDs were continually rechecked and bounty hunters were always searching for disguised Jews. Fleeing a series of near-discoveries, Bertel and her mother ended up in Warsaw, where they fought in the 1943 uprising and were deported to an internment camp, along with Bertel's Polish Christian "husband." They bribed their way out of the camp to take various work assignments, navigated the Russian occupation of Poland, walked to Auschwitz to look for Eva and stowed away on a ship from Poland to Sweden, finally sailed to America. Beyond the incredible journey, this day-by-day account of a teenager learning "survival dexterity"&#x2014;how to extract assistance from the ambivalent, how to sense danger in the slightest gesture&#x2014;is unforgettable.

"Arse first," announced the midwife, wiping her hands on a length of towel after examining her patient. "Bound to be a boy, they always cause the most trouble." <br> Isabelle closed her eyes and reclined against the piled bolsters. Throughout the morning the contractions had become steadily more frequent and painful. Her women had unbraided her hair so there would be no bindings about her person to tie the baby in the womb, and the thick, wheat-gold strands spilled over shoulders and engorged breasts to touch her mounded belly. "He" was already late. Her husband had hoped to greet his new offspring before setting out to war ten days ago, but instead had had to bid Isabelle farewell with a kiss at arm's length, her pregnant belly like a mountain between them. It was May now. If she survived bearing this child and he lived through the summer's campaign, they would see each other in the autumn.<br> For now, he was somewhere deep in the Beauvaisis with his sovereign, and she was wishing she was anywhere but this stuffy chamber undergoing the ordeal of childbirth. A contraction started low in her spine and tightened across her womb. Pain bloomed through her lower body, causing her to gasp and clench her fists. "Always hurts more when they come tail first." The midwife looked shrewdly at Isabelle. "It's not your first; you know what to expect, but infants that enter the world by their backsides have a dangerous passage. Head comes last and that's not good for the babe. Best pray to the blessed Saint Margaret for her help." She indicated the painted wooden image standing on a coffer at the bedside surrounded by a glow of votive candles.<br> "I have been praying to her every day since I knew I was with child," Isabelle said irritably, not adding that the overdue birth of a baby in the breech position was hardly a happy reward for her devotion. She was coming to abhor the statue. Whoever had carved it had put a sanctimonious expression on its face that fell little short of a smirk.<br> The next contraction wrung her in its grip and with it the urge to push. The midwife signaled to the girl assisting her and busied herself between Isabelle's thighs. "You should summon your chaplain to christen the child, immediately," she announced, her voice muffled by the raised sheet. "Do you have a name?"<br> "Gilbert for a boy, and Isabelle for a girl," Isabelle gritted through her teeth as she bore down. The contraction receded. Slumping against the bolsters she panted at one of her women to fetch Father Walter and have him wait in the antechamber.<br> The next pain seized her, then the next and the next, fierce and hard, no respite now as her body strove to expel the baby from her womb. She sobbed and grunted with effort, tendons cording her throat, her hands gripping those of her attendants hard enough to leave lasting weals on their flesh.<br> There was a sudden gush of wet heat between her thighs and the midwife groped. "Ah," she said with satisfaction. "I was right, it is a boy. Ha-ha, fine pair of hammers on him too!<br> Let's see if we can keep him alive to have use of them, eh? Push again, my lady. Not so fast, not so fast. Go gently now." Isabelle bit her lip and struggled not to push as hard as her instincts dictated. Taking the baby's ankles, tugging gently, the midwife drew his torso up and on to Isabelle's abdomen. As the mouth and nose emerged from the birth canal she wiped them clear of blood and mucus, then, watching intently, controlled the emergence of the rest of the head with a gentle hand. Propped on her elbows, Isabelle stared at the baby lying upon her body like a drowned, shipwrecked sailor. His colour was greyish-blue and he wasn't moving. Panic shot through her. "Holy Saint Margaret, is he...?"<br> The woman lifted the baby by his ankles, swung him gently, and applied a sharp tap to his buttocks, then again. A shudder rippled through him, his little chest expanded, and a wail of protest met the air, uncertain at first, but gathering momentum and infusing his body with a flush of life-giving pink. Righting him, the midwife turned to Isabelle, a smile deepening the creases in her wrinkled cheeks. "Just needed a bit of persuading," she said. "Best have the priest name him though, to be on the safe side." She wrapped him in a warm towel and placed him in Isabelle's arms.<br> The cord having been cut and the afterbirth expelled and taken away for burial, Isabelle gazed into the birth-crumpled features of her newborn son and, still deeply anxious, watched his shallow breathing. A baffled, slightly quizzical frown puckered his brows. His fists were tightly clenched as if to fight the world into which he had been so brutally initiated. "Gilbert," she said softly. "I wonder what your father is going to make of you." She blew softly against his cheek and gave him her forefinger around which to curl his miniature hand. After a moment, she lifted her gaze from the baby and fixed it on her chamber window and the arch of soft blue sky it framed. Her own ordeal was almost over and, God willing, if she did not take the childbed fever, she would soon be on her feet. Saint Margaret could be thanked with an offering and packed away in her coffer again until needed again. Now she would concentrate on prayers for her husband's safety and ask God to bring him home in one piece to greet their new son.</p></p><h2>Everyone Comes to Elaine&#39;s: Forty Years of Movie Stars, All-Stars, Literary Lions, Financial Scions, Top Cops, Politicians, and Power Brokers at the Legendary Hot Spot</h2><p><p>Pull up a seat.

Lysander and Sulla (Loeb Classical Libraryï¿½) (Volume IV)</h2><p><p>Plutarch (Plutarchus), ca. 45&#x2013;120 CE, was born at Chaeronea in Boeotia in central Greece, studied philosophy at Athens, and, after coming to Rome as a teacher in philosophy, was given consular rank by the emperor Trajan and a procuratorship in Greece by Hadrian. He was married and the father of one daughter and four sons. He appears as a man of kindly character and independent thought, studious and learned.</p><p>Plutarch wrote on many subjects. Most popular have always been the 46 <i>Parallel Lives</i>, biographies planned to be ethical examples in pairs (in each pair, one Greek figure and one similar Roman), though the last four lives are single. All are invaluable sources of our knowledge of the lives and characters of Greek and Roman statesmen, soldiers and orators.

But not to worry--he's leaving his brother Bob to mind the farm: "I wrote everything down for you. Just follow my instructions and everything will be fine. But keep an eye on Duck. He's trouble." Of course, fans of Doreen Cronin and Betsy Lewin's last brilliant book already know to keep an eye on that manipulative mallard. Now, wait a minute... what's Duck doing eyeing that pencil?<p> Poor Bob has no idea what he's in for, and Duck and friends have shrewdly seized this chance to move on from collective bargaining to outright subterfuge: "Bob gave Duck a good long stare and went inside. He read the first note: 'Tuesday night is pizza night (not the frozen kind!). The hens prefer anchovies.'" Well, seems like strange way to run a farm, but... "Twenty-nine minutes later there was hot pizza in the barn." Giggle, giggle, quack, indeed.</p><p> Clearly, Duck and his cow pals aren't the only ones around to have mastered the pencil and the keyboard. Cronin and Lewin have put their talents to good use yet again, offering up another simple but clever story fit for kids and grownups alike. Lewin seems to snicker throughout her playful watercolors (gotta love those monogrammed towels: "FB"), and Cronin has a ball with the animal cast and their human patsy.

There are a total of 90 projects, for everyone from beginners to the most advanced quilters.<br><br>Jinzenji is also a superb natural dyer and often makes quilts from fabric or fiber she colors herself, including very subtle and rich bamboo-dyed white silk.<br><br>In other quilts she uses antique fabric collected from around the world, and in still others vibrant tropical natural dyes or innovative synthetics such as black metallic cloth created by well-known textile designer Jun'ichi Arai. No matter what the material, her quilts all have a remarkable quiet power. They resonate with a spiritual quality like that of classic North American quilts, but one that is rooted in an Asian, even Buddhist sensibility.<br><br>Jinzenji has always wanted to "give something back" to the Western quilting tradition that first motivated her own work, and with this book she is wonderfully successful. Quiltmakers and all others with an interest in textiles or design will find <em>Quilt Artistry</em> as inspirational as it is practical.</p><p>[The opening pages of the first section of Part 1, accompanied in the original by three full-color photos and two black-and-whites] <p>Part 1: Quilts Made from Antique Cloth and New Textiles </p><p>My Quilting Journey </p><p>I have a very clear memory of my first encounter with quilts. It was in Toronto in the winter of 1970, in the furniture section of Eaton's department store downtown. There, surrounded by standardized fluffy bedspreads, were two handmade quilts draped over wooden racks. I went over to them as if drawn by a magnet and took them in my hand, wondering what on earth these handmade quilts were doing in the middle of a display of manufactured goods. The oddity of the combination was stunning. The quilts were made by joining together many small pieces of cloth and then covering the whole with fine hand stitching. Each had a price tag, and I was stunned again to see that they were not much more expensive than the manufactured spreads. Who could have made these, I asked myself, and what had inspired their beautiful handwork? The riddle of the quilts' existence made them endlessly fascinating tome and the search for answers became all-consuming. </p><p>I soon found out that they had been made by women of the Mennonite community of Waterloo County, dozens of miles west of Toronto. On weekend expeditions, little by little I became acquainted with the religious community of men and women who dressed in simple black clothes and traveled in horse-drawn buggies (later my quest would also take me to the Amish people of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania). Every chance I got, I would set off early in the morning to visit the Farmers' Market that was run by the Mennonite people, where I would get some of their fresh-picked sweet corn. In early spring I went to the Maple Sugar Festival and saw steam rising from huge vats of sap being boiled down and many other old-time sights. And there were always hand-stitched quilts on display that I could touch and examine. Quilts made by women of the community were entered in the Relief Sale, while others went on auction all over the region. I learned that the history of Mennonite relief efforts had included shipping vast quantities of powdered milk and wheat to Japan after World War II, some of which had been used in school lunches when I was a little girl. The discovery of such an unsuspected personal link to the Mennonite community was deeply moving. </p><p>The donation of proceeds from the auction of Mennonite and Amish quilts for assistance and relief programs around the world gives the community quiltmaker a role of global significance. I realized that the world of women's handwork was making a huge contribution to the welfare of humanity, and that helped inspire my eventual decision to devote my own life to quilting. At the same time I learned that Amish quilts were now being recognized and sought after by museums and private collectors as modern art. That is because their simplicity and understated beauty appeal directly to the human heart. </p><p>I was awestruck by the power I found in the quilts, as if they were tremendous wedges driven into the modern world to preserve what is most basic and wholesome in the human spirit. The natural dyes from the second half of the nineteenth century, the handwoven wool, the bold two-toned patterns, tranquil yet strong; the unique color composition and above all the deeply religious spirit -- all of it was a revelation. I set out to study on my own the message that women inscribed in North American history, using their needles to piece together the stories of their lives. </p><p>I became determined to unravel secrets of the craft from every angle. I visited antique markets to buy old quilts that I then took apart to investigate the stitching, binding and materials, and lingered in museums to study designs and simply to look. Then in 1979 the Ontario Crafts Council awarded its Provincial Prize to my work, "Star Quilt," saying that they had singled it out for its inventive use of color. That was very encouraging, since it seemed to confirm my own sense that the best way for me to develop creatively was to focus on combinations of colors and combinations of materials. </p><p>I began to feel strongly that I needed to learn more about materials, and particularly about the indigenous dyeing culture of my own country. I returned to Japan after more than ten years in Canada, to find out all I could. My interest centered on kimono -- the traditional costume of Japan -- and I began using kimono fabric in quilts of my own design. In fact, my interest in kimono was of long standing, since my grandmother, my mother and I were all accustomed to wearing that style of clothing in daily life; from age nine to twenty-three I'd studied flower arranging and tea ceremony, both traditional pastimes where the old kimono culture survives intact. I soon realized that my long familiarity with the garment -- accustomed as I was from an early age to the feel of it against my skin -- had nurtured in me an instinctive ability to select the finest kimono material. </p><p>In the course of things I began to teach classes in quilting. The art of quilting was a catalyst allowing large numbers of women to develop interests outside the home and to share the joy of making things as we all learned together. The classes reminded me of the value of many things: patience with the elderly, encouragement, friendships that could grow out of classroom situations, harmony in interpersonal relationships. At the same time I felt a keen sense of responsibility as I tried to guide others in their creative endeavors. </p><p>Meeting textile planner Jun'ichi Arai was another seminal experience for me. I was very taken with his contemporary fabrics, which while using impossibly innovative technology still capture something of the human soul. His skillful application of cutting-edge technology makes possible the creation of textures that could once have been made only by hand. Touching Mr. Arai's creations made me realize anew how indispensable fine fabric is to the world of quilting. Inspired by the many extraordinary fabrics he invented, I began to broaden my concept of quilting. It seemed to me that making quilts with these very contemporary fabrics -- particularly quilts that were based on established patterns -- could be a way to honor and even highlight the essence of the traditional forms, by combining them with innovative synthetic fabrics. Working with Mr. Arai's textiles, though, demands the use of a sewing machine, since they can have such wildly varying textures. I began to conceive of machine-stitched quilts as another valid form of expression in the craft. </p><p>Just at that time, various new possibilities opened up, thanks to the influence of my family. My father-in-law, a professor of art education, encouraged students in Japan and Indonesia to visit one another's countries, and I soon began traveling there as well. In 1983 I held my first quilt exhibition in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, and from then on I traveled back and forth many times between that country and my own, steadily educating myself about Asian dyeing and doing fieldwork. My studies led me into many new paths, and the more I learned, the more solid my grasp of the whole became.</p>Introduction <p>For me, quilting and natural dyeing are complementary elements in the same act of transforming cloth. </p><p>The quilts that initially inspired me to begin quilting, and that continue to fascinate me, are antique Amish and Mennonite works. After I began quilting about thirty years ago, I traveled many times to Indonesia, eventually establishing my studio there, and at one point I encountered the Indonesian selendang, a striking traditional shawl that very much resembled the Amish quilts that I already loved. </p><p>I wondered what it was that these two forms had in common, since the selendang is not quilted or pieced, and then I realized that they both were dyed with natural dye. This drove home to me the power of dyeing cloth with natural materials. </p><p>Quilting, dyeing, and the combinations of textures in the cloth itself -- all are elements that alter the surface of cloth, adding shadows and shapes that reflect light in different ways, and creating a pleasing rhythm of alternating tension and relaxation. </p><p>In addition to natural dyeing, I have often made quilts from the extremely innovative synthetic materials made by Jun'ichi Arai, one of Japan's best-known textile designers. In any case, no matter what the material, what I am striving for is to bring out and add to the essential textures of the cloth, to create shadows and light, and to find a balance between minimalism and a sense of richness. </p><p>My work has always been a natural progression from one interest to the next -- one adventure or experiment after another -- and this book is basically a record of that adventure. </p><p>I have received so much inspiration from traditions that arose outside Japan -- primarily from the quilting of North America and also from Asian dyeing and weaving traditions. I hope that by publishing this introduction to my work in English I can give back to the quilting world a little bit of what I have received.</p></p><h2>Mornings With Thomas Merton: Readings and Reflections</h2><p>Here is a provocative collection of daily readings and reflections drawn from the writings of worldly-man-turned-monk, Thomas Merton, designed to flood our dark moods with light, changing the way we see everything.</p><p></p><h2>Building By The Book</h2><p>In all, &#34;Building by the Book&#34; reflects a thorough study in what is probably a neglected period of building, whereby middle class owners were enabled to build architect-designed homes which would otherwise have been reserved for the wealthy.

Also explained are specialized repair techniques for hundreds of cameras and accessories, how to build test instruments, where to find parts and supplies, and much more.</p><p>Thomas Tomosy is a European-trained camera technician, teacher, and writer. He is the author of &#34;Restoring the Great Classic and Collectible Cameras,&#34; &#34;Restoring the Great Collectible Cameras (1945-70),&#34; and &#34;Camera Maintenance and Repair, Book 2.&#34; He livBoth these books offer a good overview of camera maintenance and repair, particularly for amateur and professional photographers who wish to undertake cleaning, basic maintenance, and minor repairs of their own cameras. Though most photographers may still find extensive repairs beyond their interest and ability, these books can help owners save money on costly maintenance and will teach them more about their cameras. Neither book is comprehensive, which would be impossible given the abundance and variety of cameras manufactured over the past 150 years. Tomosy tends to emphasize more popular 35mm cameras and does not even include information about view cameras. Romney arranged his book more logically by camera parts (e.g., leaf shutters, lenses, and exposure meters) as well as by type of camera and camera system, including view cameras. Readers will find the indexes and illustrations (both photos and diagrams) in both books to be very useful. If one can afford only one title, Tomosy's will appeal to those most interested in cleaning and maintenance of new 35mm cameras. Romney's will be appreciated by those interested in cameras as precise instruments, including collectors of antique cameras. Both books are recommended for all public libraries and academic libraries with photography collections.<br><i>- Raymond Bial, Parkland Coll.

An enthralling story of genius, passion, and competition, <i>Lost Languages </i>provides a revealing look at how decipherment is done.

Then it tackles the important scripts still awaiting their decipherers. </p><p> </p><p>Perhaps the greatest challenge today is the <b>Indus script</b>. Found on exquisitely beautiful seal stones, pottery, and copper tablets excavated in Pakistan and India, it is the only writing of the four "first" civilizations that cannot be read. Unraveled, it would not only break the millennia-long silence of the impressive Indus Valley civilization, it would also shed new light on the origins of the Indo-European ancestors of the modern West.</p><p>Then there are the Etruscans, who have spellbound the imagination ever since Renaissance times. Builders of sensational tombs and drinkers of wine, they were the cultural conduit through which the Greek alphabet reached Rome and hence the rest of Europe. And yet the language spoken by the <b>Etruscans </b>remains wrapped in mystery; if penetrated, it could reveal the history of a pre-Roman society almost as great as ancient Greece.</p><p>And on isolated Easter Island, the exotic <b>Rongorongo script</b> has long been an irresistible magnet for ambitious decipherers. Inscribed on wood with sharks' teeth and as enigmatic as the island's arresting stone faces, these texts are the only writing in pre-colonial Oceania.

Hector handed me this message on the cliffs at Miraflores. </p><p> I set the binoculars on the wall, took the note, and put it in my pocket. Hector was watching my face to see if there was annoyance or even dread in my eyes, but I was giving nothing away. </p><p> The sun was rising over the Andes, turning the Pacific a pinkish blue. The sky to the east was a long golden gray and in the west the Southern Cross and the moon had set into the sea. </p><p> I thanked Hector with a nod and put my sunglasses on. </p><p> Wild lilacs were growing among the cacti and a warm breeze was blowing through the poplars. There was, as yet, no traffic and normally it would be peaceful up here. Just the cliffs and the beach and the whole of the sleeping city behind me. Fog burning off the headland and a few early-morning dog walkers demonstrating that Latin love for miniature poodles and Lhasas. </p><p> "Lovely, isn't it?" I said in English. </p><p> Hector shook his head uncomprehendingly. </p><p> I smiled, watched the usual dazzling collection of seabirds rising on the thermals off the cliffs. Occasionally you'd see an albatross or a peregrine falcon and rarer still sometimes a lost condor or two. </p><p> The smell of orange blossom and oleander. </p><p> "Lima has a bad rap, but I like it," I said in Spanish. </p><p> Especially this time of day before the two-stroke motors and the diesel engines and the coal fires really got going. Hector nodded, pleased with the remark and happy that he'd found me before I retired to bed. He knew that after the night shift I liked to come here with a cup of coffee. Last week I came to watch the first transit of Venus in living memory but mostly it was either to do some amateur ornithology or, he suspected, to stare through the binocs at the pretty surfer girls catching the big rolling breakers at the meeting of the continent and the ocean. </p><p> Today about a dozen early surfers, all of them in their teens, wearing full wet suits, booties, and gloves. Half of them female, a new feature of the scene in the city. None of them looked like Kit, the surfer girl I'd been forced to kill in Maine a long time ago, but they all reminded me of her -- I mean, that's the sort of thing you never get over. </p><p> I sipped the coffee, frowned at the sound of a power drill. This particular morning, much to my annoyance, it was not quiet up here. There were a score of grips and roadies building the set for a free concert by the Indian Chiefs. They were working with un-Peruvian noise and diligence and it didn't surprise me at all to see that their supervisor was an Australian. </p><p> Hector blinked at me in that obvious way of his, to prod me into action. </p><p> "Thanks for the note, Hector, you go on home," I said. </p><p> "Is everything ok, boss?" he asked. </p><p> "No, but I'll take care of it," I responded. </p><p> Hector nodded. He was still only a kid. I'd been training him for about three months and he didn't look at all uncomfortable in the suit and tie that I'd bought for him. I'd taught Hector to be polite, calm, well mannered and now he could be employed as a bouncer anywhere in the world. I'm sure the customers at the Lima Miraflores Hilton had no idea that Hector lived in a house he had built himself in the pueblos jï¿½venes slums to the east of here, where the walls were corrugated metal sheets, where water came from a stand pipe and sewage ran in the street. Displaced from his shanty, Hector appeared elegant, poised, and aristocratic. The marriage of a conquistador bloodline with Inca royalty. And he was smart and he had compassion. He was an ideal lieutenant. He couldn't be more than twenty-one or twenty-two; he'd go far, probably have my job in five or six years. </p><p> "It seems a bit early for this kind of nonsense," he said with a resigned shake of the head. He was talking about the contents of the note. </p><p> "It's either very early or very late," I agreed. </p><p> "Are you sure you don't want me to deal with it, I don't mind," Hector said with another look of sympathy. </p><p> He knew I'd had a rough night of it. A kid from Sweden had taken an overdose and I'd had to see him to the hospital, then I kicked some whores out of the lobby, and then we'd dealt with an elderly American couple who claimed they couldn't breathe in the polluted air and wanted an oxygen machine. Later today the Japanese ambassador to Peru was coming for an informal breakfast talk on the possibility of extraditing disgraced Peruvian ex-president Fujimori from his bolt hole in Tokyo. The talks wouldn't go anywhere but it was good for all parties to be seen looking for a solution. Good for the hotel especially. The ambassador had his own security people, but we didn't need a disturbance wrecking the tranquility of the visit. </p><p> "No, I'll fix it, Hector, you can go on home," I said. </p><p> Hector nodded, walked back across the street to change into his jeans and T-shirt for the scooter ride to the slums. He'd been on the night shift, too, and was bound to be tired. </p><p> The surfers were doing lazy cutbacks and the sun was inching over those high, dry mountains that someday I'd go and visit. A blind man had recently climbed Everest, so surely I, a man challenged merely with an artificial foot, could hike the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu. </p><p> I took a big swig of the coffee and set down the cup. </p><p> A few schoolgirls had come by to see if the roadies could give them backstage passes to the Chiefs; the roadies had none to give away but they chatted up the girls anyway. </p><p> "Get your backs into it, you dago bastards," the Australian foreman barked. Without the note drawing me away to business I might have gone over and smacked that bugger for spoiling my meditations. </p><p> I looked at the message. It was easy enough to decipher. </p><p> In stateroom LY (that is, the fiftieth floor, suite Y), a Plum (in other words, a drunk American) named Mr. P. Buck was creating a Mulligan (i.e., a disturbance). The codes had been established by the previous head of security at the Miraflores Hilton, an avid golfer. At some point I was going to drop the references to Mulligans, Eagles, Birdies, and the like. But I'd only been here for a few months and there were other, more pressing priorities. </p><p> I sighed, crumpled the note in disgust, and threw it in the nearest garbage can. </p><p> A drunk American, probably fighting with a prostitute. </p><p> P. Buck -- I wondered if R.E.M. were in town, the guitarist was called Peter Buck and had once been arrested and acquitted of being drunk and disorderly on a British Airways flight. I shook my head. If an American rock star had been staying at my hotel, I would have known about it before now. Still, Peter Buck was one of my heroes and I crossed the street with a heightened level of expectation. </p><p> The hotel was new, tall, gleaming with glass and curved stainless steel -- like something Frank Gehry might have come up with on a bad day. </p><p> Tinco, the nervous Ecuadorean night manager, grabbed me at the double doors. </p><p> "I heard," I said before he could open his mouth. </p><p> "Stateroom LY, hurry, please, we have the Japanese ambassador arriving this morning," he said, grasping his hands in front of him in a pleading gesture. </p><p> "I know," I said. "Don't worry, relax, I'll take care of it." </p><p> "One of the girls has complained," he said, looking sadly at the floor. </p><p> "Which girls? The hookers?" </p><p> "The maid. She's very young." </p><p> He wanted me to come up with a solution before I'd even assessed what the problem was. </p><p> "Ok, I'll send her away for a week and when she comes back you give her a raise and we'll keep an eye on her to see if she keeps her mouth shut. Got it?" </p><p> Tinco nodded. I yawned and headed for the bank of elevators. </p><p> Usually I showered and went to bed now and slept until two or three in the afternoon, when the older, tradition-bound Peruvians were getting up from their siestas. And like I say, it had been a tedious, tiring night and I was looking forward to some shut-eye. </p><p> Hopefully, this wouldn't take too long. </p><p> I pressed the P button and the lift sped me up to the penthouses on the fiftieth floor. It was a boast of the hotel that it was one of the tallest buildings in South America but even the express elevators seemed to take forever. </p><p> I took the time to adjust my appearance in the mirror. </p><p> My hair was in the crew cut of an Israeli commando, dirty blond, but recently I'd noticed a couple of gray strands around the ears. I hadn't had a chance to shave, and I looked a little rougher than usual, though the Peruvian sun had done much to erase the obvious Paddy pallor in my features. I'd do. </p><p> The elevator doors clicked. </p><p> I checked guns one and two, hitched down the bottom of my trousers, drank the rest of my coffee. I turned left and strolled toward room LY. </p><p> The sound of fighting coming down the hall. No, not fighting, someone smashing things up. </p><p> So he hadn't got himself exhausted just yet. </p><p> I hastened my pace. </p><p> Nice up here.

The result is a rich and fascinating look at where we've been, at the recipes our mothers and grandmothers loved, and at how our own tastes have evolved.<br><br>The more than 500 cherished recipes in these pages are mainstays of American home cooking, the recipes that have remained favorites year after year. For the smallest sampling:<br><br>California dip . . . Buffalo chicken wings . . . vichyssoise . . . tuna-noodle casserole . . . Swiss steak . . . frosted meat loaf . . . tamale pie . . . corn dogs . . . lobster rolls . . . classic green bean bake . . . perfection salad . . . green goddess salad . . . frozen fruit salad . . . chiffon cake . . . brownies . . . chocolate chip cookies . . . chocolate decadence<br><br>Beyond this collection is Jean's exploration of the diversity of our nation's cuisine and our adoption of such "foreign" dishes as pizza, gazpacho, lasagne, moussaka, and tarte tatin. Her painstakingly researched text includes extensive headnotes, thumbnail profiles of important people and products (from Fannie Farmer to James Beard and from electric refrigerators to the microwave), and a timeline of major 20th-century food firsts. <br><br>In recording popular recipes that might have been lost, in setting them in richly detailed historical context, Jean Anderson has written her masterwork. The American Century Cookbook may well be the most important new cookbook of the decade; it is certainly the book America will love.</p><p>Thank goodness Jean Anderson's <i>The American Century Cookbook</i> is as much a culinary page-turner as a call to the kitchen, because most of the 20th century's favorites are killers according to modern nutritional standards. Try to be satisfied learning that chocolate brownies and meatloaf, as we know it, were born back when most cooks relied on a wood-burning stove, and resist the urge to whip up a Grasshopper Pie or batch of Cherry Winks. Be assured, though, all 500-plus recipes work to perfection, including the one for Perfection Salad, the gelatin mold that started it all back in 1905. Charting trends along with the origins of specific dishes, Jean Anderson shares the significance of landmark cookbooks, from <i>The Fannie Farmer Cookbook,</i> to Craig Claiborne's <i>The New York Times Cook Book,</i> and Julia Child's <i>Mastering the Art of French Cooking.</i> Sea changes cited are the acceptance of foreign cuisines and the idea that cooking can be a pastime as well as a necessity. A few landmark recipes include Clam Dip, Gazpacho, Guacamole, Sloppy Joes, New York-Style Cheesecake, and Banana-Nut Bread. Find your favorites set in context by Anderson's painstaking research.A member of the James Beard Who's Who of Food and Wine in America, Jean Anderson is the author of more than twenty cookbooks, among them the award-winning Food of Portugal and the best-selling Doubleday Cookbook (with Elaine Hanna), which was named Cookbook of the Year in the R.T.

Not of any single person thinking, nor even a group thinking, collectively. It&#x2019;s bigger than that, wider&#x2014;and more direct. It&#x2019;s like the sound of thought itself, its hum and rush. Each night, when Serge drops in on it, it recoils with a wail, then rolls back in crackling waves that carry him away, all rudderless, until his finger, nudging at the dial, can get some traction on it all, some sort of leeway. The first stretches are angry, plaintive, sad&#x2014;and always mute. It&#x2019;s not until, hunched over the potentiometer among fraying cords and soldered wires, his controlled breathing an extension of the frequency of air he&#x2019;s riding on, he gets the first quiet clicks that words start forming: first he jots down the signals as straight graphite lines, long ones and short ones, then, below these, he begins to transcribe curling letters, dim and grainy in the arc light of his desktop . . .<br><br>He&#x2019;s got two masts set up. There&#x2019;s a twenty-two-foot pine one topped with fifteen more feet of bamboo, all bolted to an oak-stump base halfburied in the Mosaic Garden. Tent pegs circle the stump round; steel guy wires, double-insulated, climb from these to tether the mast down. On the chimney of the main house, a pole three feet long reaches the same height as the bamboo. Between the masts are strung four eighteen-gage manganese copper wires threaded through oak-lath crosses. In Serge&#x2019;s bedroom, there&#x2019;s a boxed tuning coil containing twenty feet of silkcovered platinoid, shellacked and scraped. Two dials are mounted on the box&#x2019;s lid: a large, clock-handed one dead in the centre and, to its right, a smaller disc made from ash-wood recessed at the back and dotted at the front by twenty little screws with turned-down heads set in a circle to form switch-studs. The detector&#x2019;s brass with an adjusting knob of ebonite; the condenser&#x2019;s Murdock; the crystal, Chilean gelina quartz, a Mighty Atom mail-ordered from Gamage of Holborn. For the telephone, he tried a normal household one but found it wasn&#x2019;t any use unless he replaced the diaphragms, and moved on to a watch-receiverpattern headset wound to a resistance of eight and a half thousand ohms. The transmitter itself is made of standard brass, a four-inch tapper arm keeping Serge&#x2019;s finger a safe distance from the spark gap. The spark gap flashes blue each time he taps; it makes a spitting noise, so loud he&#x2019;s had to build a silence box around the desk to isolate his little RX station from the sleeping household&#x2014;or, as it becomes more obvious to him with every session, to maintain the little household&#x2019;s fantasy of isolation from the vast sea of transmission roaring all around it.<br><br>Tonight, as on most nights, he starts out local, sweeping from two hundred and fifty to four hundred metres. It&#x2019;s the usual traffic: CQ signals from experimental wireless stations in Masedown and Eliry, tapping out their call signs and then slipping into Q-code once another bug&#x2019;s responded. They exchange signal quality reports, compare equipment, enquire about variations in the weather and degrees of atmospheric interference. The sequence QTC, which Serge, like any other <i>Wireless World </i>subscriber, knows means &#x201c;Have you anything to transmit?&#x201d;, is usually met with a short, negative burst before both questioner and responder move on to fish for other signals. Serge used to answer all CQs, noting each station&#x2019;s details in his call-book; lately, though, he&#x2019;s become more selective in the signals he&#x2019;ll acknowledge, preferring to let the small-fry click away as background chatter, only picking up the pencil to transcribe the dots and dashes when their basic QRNs and QRAs unfold into longer sequences. This is happening right now: an RXer in Lydium who calls himself &#x201c;Wireworm&#x201d; is tapping out his thoughts about the Postmaster General&#x2019;s plans to charge one guinea per station for all amateurs.<br><br>&#x201c;. . . tht bedsteads n gas pipes cn b used as rcving aerials is well-kn0n I mslf hv dn this,&#x201d; Wireworm&#x2019;s boasting, &#x201c;als0 I cn trn pian0 wire in2 tuning coil fashion dtctrs from wshing s0da n a needle mst I obtain lcnses 4 ths wll we gt inspctrs chcking r pots n pans 2 C tht they cnfrm 2 rgulatns I sgst cmpaign cvl ds0bdns agnst such impsitions . . .&#x201d; <br><br>Transcribing his clicks, Serge senses that Wireworm&#x2019;s not so young: no operator under twenty would bother to tap out the whole word &#x201c;fashion.&#x201d; The spacing&#x2019;s a little awkward also: too studied, too self-conscious. Besides, most bugs can improvise equipment: he once made Bodner&#x2019;s spade conduct a signal and the house&#x2019;s pipes vibrate and resonate, sending Frieda running in panic from her bath . . . <br><br>Serge moves up to five hundred metres. Here are stronger, more decisive signals: coastal stations&#x2019; call signs, flung from towering masts. Poldhu&#x2019;s transmitting its weather report; a few nudges away, Malin, Cleethorpes, Nordeich send out theirs. Liverpool&#x2019;s exchanging messages with tugboats in the Mersey: Serge transcribes a rota of towing duties for tomorrow. Further out, the lightship <i>Tongue&#x2019;s</i> reporting a derelict&#x2019;s position: the coordinates click their way in to the Seaforth station, then flash out again, to be acknowledged by Marconi operators of commercial liners, one after the other. The ships&#x2019; names reel off in litany: <i>Falaba, British Sun, Scania, Morea, Carmania</i>, each name appendaged by its church: Cunard Line, Allen, Aberdeen Direct, Canadian Pacific Railway, Holland-America. The clicks peter out, and Serge glances at the clock: it&#x2019;s half a minute before one. A few seconds later, Paris&#x2019;s call-sign comes on: FL for Eiffel. Serge taps his finger on the desktop to the rhythm of the huge tower&#x2019;s stand-by clicks, then holds it still and erect for the silent lull that always comes just before the time-code. All the operators have gone silent: boats, coastal stations, bugs&#x2014;all waiting, like him, for the quarter- second dots to set the air, the world, time itself back in motion as they<br>chime the hour.<br><br>They sound, and then the headphones really come to life. The press digest goes out from Niton, Poldhu, Malin, Cadiz:<i> Diario del Atlï¿½ntico</i>, <i>Journal de l&#x2019;Atlantique</i>, <i>Atlantic Daily News</i> . . . &#x201c;Madero and Suï¿½rez Shot in Mexico While Trying to Escape&#x201d; . . . &#x201c;Trade Pact Between&#x201d; . . . &#x201c;Entretien de&#x201d; . . . &#x201c;Shocking Domestic Tragedy in Bow&#x201d; . . . &#x201c;Il Fundatore&#x201d;. . . &#x201c;Husband Unable to Prevent&#x201d; . . . The stories blur together: Serge sees a man clutching a kitchen knife chasing a politician across parched earth, past cacti and armadillos, while ambassadors wave papers around fugitive and pursuer, negotiating terms. &#x201c;Grain Up Five, Lloyds Down Two&#x201d; . . . &#x201c;Australia All Out for Four Hundred and Twenty-one, England Sixty-two for Three in Reply&#x201d; . . .

The operators stay on after the Marconigrams have gone through, chatting to one another: Carrigan&#x2019;s moved to <i>President Lincoln</i>, Borstable to <i>Malwa</i>; the Company Football Team drew two&#x2013;all against the <i>Evening Standard</i> Eleven; old Allsop, wireless instructor at Marconi House, is getting married on the twenty-second . . . <i>His tapper-finger firing up her spark gap</i> . . . <i>Short, then long</i> . . . <i>Olympic</i> and <i>Campania</i> are playing a game of chess: K4 to Q7 . . . K4 to K5 . . . They always start K4 . . . Serge transcribes for a while, then lays his pencil down and lets the sequences run through the space between his ears, sounding his skull: there&#x2019;s a fluency to them, a rhythm that&#x2019;s spontaneous, as though the clicks were somehow speaking on their own and didn&#x2019;t need the detectors, keys or finger-twitching men who cling to them like afterthoughts . . .<br><br>He climbs to six hundred, and picks up ice reports sent out from whalers: floeberg/growler 51n 10' 45.63" lat 36w 12' 39.37 long . . . field ice 59n 42' 43.54" lat 14w 45' 56.25" long . . . Compagnie de Tï¿½lï¿½graphie sans Fil reports occasional light snow off Friesland.<br>Paris comes on again; again the cycle pauses and restarts. Then Bergen, Crookhaven, Tarifa, Malaga, Gibraltar. Serge pictures gardenias tucked behind girls&#x2019; ears, red dresses and the blood of bulls. He hears news forwarded, via Port Said and Rome, from Abyssinia, and sees an African girl strumming on some kind of mandolin, jet-black breasts glowing darkly through light silk. Suez is issuing warnings of Somali raiders further down the coast. More names process by: Isle of Perim, Zanzibar, Isle of Socotra, Persian Gulf. Parades of tents line themselves up for him: inside them, dancers serving sherbet; outside, camels saddled with rich carpets, deserts opening up beneath red skies. The air is rich tonight: still and cold, high pressure, the best time of year. He lets a fart slip from his buttocks, and waits for its vapour to reach his nostrils: it, too, carries signals, odour-messages from distant, unseen bowels. When it arrives, he slips the headphones off, opens the silence cabin&#x2019;s door to let some air in and hears a goods train passing half a mile away. The pulsing of its carriage-joins above the steel rails carries to him cleanly. He looks down at his desk: the half-worn pencil, the light&#x2019;s edge across the paper sheet, the tuning box, the tapper. These things&#x2014;here, solid, tangible&#x2014; are somehow made more present by the tinny sound still spilling from the headphones lying beside them.

Cole abandons a career with a prestigious hospital to build a private practice in a small Berkshire town, becoming deeply involved in the lives of her patients as she struggles with her ability to sense impending death. Lit Guild &amp; Doubleday.</p><p>With <b>Choices,</b> Noah Gordon brings to a close his great trilogy spanning the generations of the Cole medical dynasty. Beginning with the legendary 11th&#x2013;century doctor Robert J. Cole, each eldest son has borne the same name and middle initial, and some have possessed the uncanny &#x201c;sixth sense&#x201d;known as The Gift: the terrible and instinctive knowledge that someone is about to die. In <b>Choices,</b> it emerges again in the present, but this time in a daughter, Roberta Jeanne d&#x2019;Arc Cole, known as R.J. The first time R.J. defies her beloved father is when she is born a female; the second, when she chooses to study law rather than medicine. Yet destiny is to overtake her when R.J. realizes that she has inherited The Gift. As she holds the hands of a sick man, R.J. feels a dreadful certainty that he is going to die; tragically, he is her own lover. Struggling with her grief, R.J. knows she must bow to the inevitable and become a physician. But her life changes when she moves to a small&#x2013;town practice and is faced with a terrible dilemma &#x2014; and an important choice to make.<b>Noah Gordon</b> has won many awards, including the James Fenimore Cooper Prize; among his books are <i>The Physician, Shaman, The Jerusalem Diamond, The Rabbi, The Last Jew, </i>and <i>The Death Committee.</i></p><h2>Old Fashioned Thanksgiving</h2><p>Follows the activities of seven children in nineteenth-century New England as they prepare for the Thanksgiving holiday while Mother is away caring for Grandmother.</p><p><p> Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888) is the author of the beloved <i>Little Women</i>, which was based on her own experiences growing up in New England with her parents and three sisters. More than a century after her death, Louisa May Alcott's stories continue to delight readers of all ages. </p>Grade 4-5-- When their parents are called away to care for an ailing grandmother, seven children continue preparations for the family's Thanksgiving meal, hoping to surprise and cheer their parents on their return. And although the plum pudding is rock-hard and the turkey stuffing bitter, the children's efforts are appreciated, and the holiday gathering is enjoyed by all. A high-spirited, good-humored account of a rural, 19th-century New Hampshire Thanksgiving, this story demonstrates Alcott's belief that health, hard work, and cheery good will are of greater value than wealth and position. Her description of children gives the impression that she both understood and liked them. This new edition is handsome, both in layout and in illustration. McCurdy's nine, colored-wood engravings are arresting, and are in great contrast to Holly Johnson's many, homey drawings done for an earlier edition (Lippincott, 1974). Johnson's drawings are perhaps more in keeping with the realistic and homespun nature of Alcott's story, but there's much pleasure to be had in the fine quality of McCurdy's artwork. --Cynthia Bishop, Onondaga County Public Library, Syracuse, NY<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Power That Changes the World: Creating Eternal Impact in the Here and Now</h2><p><b>Exciting New Teaching from Bestselling Author and Bethel Church Leader Bill Johnson<br></b><br>Two realities are evident in today's broken world: Our culture is in desperate need, and our God is a miracle-working God.

Her books include Coronation Everest, Venice, The Pax Britannica Trilogy (Heaven&#39;s Command, Pax Britannica, and Farewell the Trumpets), and Conundrum. She is also the author of six books about cities and countries, two autobiographical books, several volumes of collected travel essays and, more recently, the unclassifiable Trieste and the Meaning of Nowhere. A Writer&#39;s World, a collection of her travel writing and reportage from over five decades, was published in 2003. Hav, her novel, was published in a new and expanded form in 2006 and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and the Arthur C. Clarke Award. Her most recent book, Contact!, about the people she encountered on her many travels, was published in 2009.More than 29,000 feet above sea level amid the desolation and frost of the Himalayas looms the sublime summit of Mount Everest, the very top of the world. Special correspondent for the London Times and an eyewitness to the climb, Morris (then James Morris) recounts Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay's famous ascent of the mountain. The first climb ever to reach the top of Everest culminated on May 29, 1953, two days before the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II--a truly royal gift for the young monarch. The quest begins in isolated Katmandu and trudges steadily eastward across the valley to the foot of Everest and upward to its pinnacle. First published in England in 1958, Morris's narrative is at times guilty of a certain sentimentalism redolent of postwar, postcolonial Britain; nevertheless it transcends its era. In vivid language and sharp detail, Morris describes the events and individuals of the historical trek. Her insightful and lively reflections on local customs and food, fauna and flora are interspersed with quiet musing on the Sherpa people and her own curiosity about the mythical Abominable Snowman. Occasionally sullied by the more down-to-earth concern over competing, news-pilfering reporters--hell-bent on snatching the story from right under her nose--Morris's ruminations oscillate between terror and beauty, ultimately surpassing laconic reporting to achieve virtuosity. At first, the author speculates as to why anyone would attempt such a formidable exploit, but her skepticism gives way to hope, and the endeavor, ostensibly that of a few adventurous souls, becomes that of all of humanity.

But before he was done, Charles Darwin would shake the faith of centuries...would be reviled as a fiend, denounced as a madman - and finally hailed as a genius. His long-time love affair and marriage to his cousin Emma Wedgewood Darwin, is one of the most delightful and fulfilling romances that history affords. His life was a storm-swept voyage of discovery - from the moment when as a raw youth he set sail on a five-year journey around the entire globe to his final years and epochal explorations into the ultimate mystery of human origins. Now Charles Darwin is brought to life in a superlative novel that captures not only the man himself but the Victorian age that produced him. These pages reveal the drama and passion of a human being struggling with doubts and fears, beset by the prejudices of his era and by unguessed-at dangers.</p><p></p><h2>Television and American Culture</h2><p>Television and American Culture College Textbook</p><p></p><h2>NIV Life Application Study Bible, Large Print</h2><p>- Application Notes -- provide penetrating insight into what the Bible says to you about how you live. - Book Introductions -- use timelines, overviews, and outlines to prepare you to hear and respond to the book&#39;s truths. - Character Sketches -- spotlight key Bible figures and the lessons you can learn from their lives. - In-text Charts and Maps -- help you locate key places and grasp difficult concepts at a glance. - Dictionary-Concordance -- developed specifically for the NIV Life Application Study Bible.</p><p>The addition of two new features make the popular NIV Life Application Study Bible even better!

It was hidden in the mountains of San Diego County, near Palomar Observatory. A patient had left the grounds and I&#x2019;d been offered the job of finding him.<br><br>The last five miles of road wound through trees that broke the late-morning light. Slats of sun and green. A guard at the gatehouse took my driver&#x2019;s license, checked my name against his appointment list, entered something on a tablet and seemed to ponder it. He handed the license back, eyes steady behind yellow glasses. &#x201c;Dr. Hulet will meet you in the lobby. Surrender all weapons and cell phones to ï¿½security.&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;Welcome to Arcadia, Mr. Ford.&#x201d;<br><br>Another steep half mile up the road stood the main building, a beveled structure of concrete and smoked glass cut into the mountainside. An expanse of lawn, parking places, groomed walkways. Flower beds waving with Iceland poppies. And seating areas, some made of carved and varnished tree stumps, where men and women of various ages talked and drank from colorful plastic tumblers. Most wore casual or business clothes, with others&#x2014;both male and female&#x2014;in white work pants and tucked-in white shirts. A few of them watched me as I got out and turned off my phone and set it inside the large tool chest bolted to my truck. Placed the phone next to my sidearm, then closed and locked the heavy lid. A white-haired man in a sport coat and bow tie gave me a thumbs-up. The April day smelled of pines.<br><br>My cursory Internet search of Arcadia hospital&#x2014;buried deep down in the search engine listings&#x2014;had revealed a state ï¿½accreditation link, a few breezy mentions in blogs and social media, and a one-page website that declared it to be an exclusive wellness community for treatment of mental and emotional disorders. The only website graphic was a watercolor of a Grecian temple on a hillside surrounded by trees. No physical address, no photographs, no additional information. A phone number and an email address and that was all.<br><br>The lobby was cool and filled with natural light steeping through the glass. Modern Scandinavian style, beige leather and chrome. Wall-mounted screens showed Curious George on KPBS San Diego. A professional-looking woman caught my eye from beyond the security gate. I emptied my pockets and removed my belt and boots and watch before stepping through the scanner. Got my things back on as she came toward me, her hand out. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Dr. Paige Hulet,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Sorry for the airport welcome.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The in-flight snacks must be something.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can offer you coffee or water, Mr. Ford.&#x201d;<br><br>She looked about my age, thirty-eight. Medium height and weight, brown hair and eyes. Black pantsuit with a white collared blouse buttoned to the top. Hair up and firmly secured, a cool hand. We walked a short hallway to a door, where she swiped the ID card on her lanyard through the lock.<br><br>We stepped into a towering atrium. Six floors up was a glass ceiling, beyond which hovered blue sky. Zigzagging ramps linked the floors all around us. People were out and about, going up and going down. &#x201c;We have elevators, or the ramps.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ramps, please. I see you let the patients dress as they like.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We call them partners, but yes. We encourage them to express themselves through dress and grooming. Most do. This way.&#x201d;<br><br>As we climbed I saw that the room doors and windows faced the open atrium, as in a hotel. The doors were painted in repeating red, yellow, and blue. No curtains or blinds. Two patients and two staffers passed us on the left, heading down the ramp, all talking loudly about a new San Diego Chargers running back. One of the patients wore a Chargers jersey and helmet. The other wore a San Diego Padres baseball cap and jersey&#x2014;#51, no less&#x2014;that of the great pitcher Trevor Hoffman. I tried to think of them as partners rather than as patients. In this American hour words meant everything and nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;Sixty beds,&#x201d; said Dr. Hulet. &#x201c;Men on floors two and three. Females, four and five.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is it unusual to mix male and female partners?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In a private community like this, no,&#x201d; said the doctor. &#x201c;And we have almost a one-to-two staff-to-partner ratio, so it&#x2019;s never a problem. One of our pillars of treatment is to create an environment that signifies normal. Dr. Briggs Spencer is our founder. He&#x2019;s a bit of a renegade, as you probably know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t realize this hospital is one of his.&#x201d;<br><br>Dr. Hulet gave me a Now you know look. &#x201c;He keeps a very low profile. For the families. Our end mission here is discharge and reintegration, when possible. We try to prepare our patients for life on the outside.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You used the wrong P-word.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do it all the time.&#x201d;<br><br>Through a fourth-floor wall of smoked glass I looked down at the flank of the mountain and the winding road that I&#x2019;d driven in on, and the heavy blanket of oaks and manzanita and conifers. Boulders the size of cars, tan and rounded, some stacked, some strewn. Directly below us I saw a kidney-shaped swimming pool, blue and shimmering, with a few swimmers and waders overseen by white-clad attendants.<br><br>The patient in question had &#x201c;left the premises&#x201d; two days ago, as Dr. Hulet had told me the previous evening by phone. When someone escapes from a place like Arcadia, the hospital will rarely call law enforcement. Too many potential embarrassments and liabilities. Mental illness still brings fear and shame, especially to the rich and powerful. Police draw media, which draw the public. So a missing patient is the responsibility of either hospital security&#x2014;which had failed to find the man&#x2014;or a private locator, such as myself. Looking down on the dense forest surrounding Arcadia I saw that our AWOL patient could easily be hunkered within a mile of the building and it might take a bloodhound to find him.<br><br>Dr. Hulet&#x2019;s office was a corner with floor-to-ceiling windows. Waiting for us was Alec DeMaris, a wedge of muscle in an expensive suit, who introduced himself as Arcadia&#x2019;s director of security. Hair short and curly, face set. His handshake was intended to punish so I punished back. Men. We sat across from Dr. Hulet, who rested her elbows on the green-marble desktop, working a never-sharpened yellow pencil with both hands. She pointed the eraser end at Alec.<br><br>&#x201c;His name is Clay Hickman and he&#x2019;s twenty-eight years old,&#x201d; said Alec. He was a notch older than me and his voice was sharp, martial. &#x201c;Missing at the lunchtime head count two days ago, Monday. We searched the compound and grounds and found where he&#x2019;d dug out under the security fence. Rough country out there. I hired a bloodhound handler from Ramona. We got some clothes from Hickman&#x2019;s hamper and the dog took off down a dirt road on the other side of the fence. Then the dog turned around and brought us back to the escape hole and went yapping up the road the other way. So we figured our boy had gotten into a vehicle. The road is public but unmaintained and not used much. Tried the dog at the three nearest gas stations down-mountain, the Amtrak stations from San Diego to Oceanside, the Greyhound station in San Diego. No scent. Nada. That went into Tuesday afternoon. The handler wanted to try a different dog but I fired him and we called you. Why you, Mr. Ford? You&#x2019;ve only got five years of experience as a PI and a rocky history with the San Diego Sheriff&#x2019;s. But I can tell you why you&#x2014;because of your good reputation as a locator, and your service in Iraq as a United States Marine. Fallujah, I gather. I was a lieutenant during Operation Iron Harvest in Iraq, a little after your time. The taking-out-the-trash phase. So here we sit, brother.&#x201d;<br><br>They say once a Marine, always a Marine, brothers for life, always faithful. I say fine, but don&#x2019;t let it cloud your judgment.<br><br>I looked at Dr. Hulet, then out the southern window for miles and miles, to where the pale desert waited. &#x201c;Why is Clay Hickman in this place?&#x201d;<br><br>Dr. Hulet&#x2019;s gaze was calm and direct. &#x201c;Schizoaffective disorder, the bipolar subset. He has been delusional, paranoid, and at times violent. He was admitted to Arcadia three years ago as a danger to himself and others. Clay Hickman is the son of Rex and Patricia Hickman&#x2014;yes, of Hickman Homes. Like you two, Clay served our country in the second Iraq war&#x2014;Air Force. He returned home in late 2009, rented an apartment in San Diego. He found some security work but was soon exhibiting symptoms of what was assumed to be PTSD&#x2014;hypervigilance, sleeplessness, anxiety, and depression. It escalated. He experienced his first psychotic break six months after coming home. He was stable for a year and a half, then broke again. The next two episodes came just six months apart. Erratic behavior. Fighting. One charge of assault with a deadly weapon&#x2014;he struck someone with a gun. Shoplifting, drunk in public, resisting arrest. Alcohol and drugs. Unaccounted for, weeks at a time. His sixth fifty-one fifty landed him in Patton State for observation. That&#x2019;s what it takes for a disturbed person to get help these days in our system. Even a veteran of war. That would have been 2014. Luckily for Clay, his family brought him to us. Mr. Ford, I want you to know that Clay Hickman&#x2014;when he&#x2019;s taking his medications and keeping himself active here in a structured setting&#x2014;is a peaceful, deep-feeling, generous young man.&#x201d;<br><br>Dr. Hulet took a deep breath and let it out slowly. &#x201c;Two years ago, when I took over his therapy here, I began to suspect that he was suffering what is now called &#x2018;moral injury.&#x2019; From the war. Some therapists call such psychological trauma a soul wound. It is caused by something you do. Not by something done to you. I&#x2019;ve published on the subject. It is very different from PTSD. They are not the same.&#x201d;<br><br>DeMaris deadpanned her.<br><br>I watched a vulture fly by the window, up close to the smoked glass. He seemed to eye his reflection, then continued his reconnaissance. As nature made him. Clay Hickman sounded a lot like some veterans I knew from my Marine days. As a veteran I wondered for the millionth time why some of us had such profoundly bad reactions to war but others did not. Why some had lost their bearings while others had managed to move on to the next thing. As nature made us? As war changes us? Either way, stress was a constant torment to all of us, and maybe an excuse to some.<br><br>&#x201c;Is he suicidal?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s shown the ideation but has made no attempt,&#x201d; said Dr. Hulet. &#x201c;Suicide is one of my biggest concerns now, with Clay in a totally foreign environment and his medications and therapy abruptly suspended. We cannot allow Clay to end his life. Veteran suicide rates run roughly double those of the general population, as you might know.&#x201d;<br><br>A moment went by. I knew a Marine who killed himself after coming home. Lenny. From Biloxi, Mississippi. Both legs amputated above the knee. Didn&#x2019;t want to live like that. I knew others&#x2014;some disabled&#x2014;who wanted very badly to live. I think I understood both sets of mind&#x2014;opposite sides of the same hard coin.<br><br>I watched the trees outside swaying in the breeze. The low temperature up in these mountains last night was thirty-nine. Not that I thought Clay Hickman was out there in the forest. I had the feeling he had covered some miles in the last two days. But it was just a feeling. &#x201c;Are you his lead doctor?&#x201d;<br><br>Dr. Hulet nodded. &#x201c;As well as Arcadia&#x2019;s medical director. His leaving surprised me. In all the hours I&#x2019;ve spent with him, he rarely talked of a life outside or of running away. I think he felt safe here.&#x201d;<br><br>Hard to believe, I thought, that an airman locked in a hospital, swank or not, wouldn&#x2019;t want to fly away. Having been married to a recreational pilot, and still being a pilot myself, I know something about flight. Flying toward or flying away. Either way, it gets into your blood and stays there. Flight is more than freedom. You are subject to nature, your own limitations, the whims of the gods. You are free to fall. &#x201c;You told me yesterday that Clay is not voluntarily here. That his father is his conservator and makes decisions on his son&#x2019;s behalf.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That is true,&#x201d; said the doctor.<br><br>&#x201c;Had his behavior changed lately?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He was restless. Not at peace. I felt that he was coming to a crossroads that he couldn&#x2019;t articulate.&#x201d;<br><br>DeMaris loudly cleared his throat. &#x201c;Mr. Ford? Or can I just call you Roland? Roland, we&#x2019;ve come to the part of the program where you tell us if you&#x2019;re going to take the job we&#x2019;ve offered you. Daylight&#x2019;s a-wastin&#x2019; and our man is in the wind. His family is extremely worried, and so are we. It was good of you to fax us your contract yesterday. Dr. Spencer has approved it and Dr. Hulet and I will sign it. But I do need to ask you, why do you only take cash?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why wouldn&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We report every penny.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So do I.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;re awfully damned expensive, too. I know. I&#x2019;m familiar with your world and your type.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then maybe you can explain me to me sometime.&#x201d;<br><br>DeMaris opened his mouth to speak, came up empty.<br><br>&#x201c;That would be my job,&#x201d; said the doctor.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll find Clay Hickman.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Illustrated Leaves of Grass</h2><p>Beautifully bound and illustrated volume of Walt Whitman&#39;s Leaves of Grass.</p><p></p><h2>God in My Corner</h2><p>The life story of George Foreman is shared in this account of how God has built George into a man of faith who is seen worldwide as a positive role model.</p><p><p>Ken Abraham&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;best-selling author known around the world for his collaborations with high-profile public figures.

In this book&#x2014;part autobiography and largely a testimonial and spiritual inspiration&#x2014;Foreman, well-known heavyweight boxing champion, businessman and preacher, leads readers through steps for living a godly Christian life. His book gives some autobiographical details, including his younger years, a few stories of his fights and most powerfully his experience of being born again after a boxing match he lost to Jimmy Young. Those stories serve to illustrate his theology, covered in short chapters that read like sermons. He exhorts readers to inspire others to excellence, answer the door when opportunity knocks, close it when temptation knocks, advance through adversity and so on. Foreman credits God with his remarkable successes throughout the book and ends it with an altar call, inviting readers to meet him in heaven someday. Non-Christian boxing fans probably won't find enough about boxing or Foreman, but evangelical Christians who admire Foreman's many good works will find the book inspirational. <i>(May 22)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But the reality behind the fantasy was a harsh one. Sexually abused by her father as a young girl, Rita constantly searched for a man to save her, marrying five times. At the age of forty-two, Alzheimer&#39;s disease began to ravage her mind, cutting short her career at its peak. A haunting and sympathetic tribute to the talented but insecure beauty who was created, and ultimately destroyed, by the movies.</p><p>Hayworth fans will learn much from this biography by the author of Orson Welles . The surprising story of the acutely shy Margarita Carmen Cansino, who was dubbed "the Love Goddess," contains more melodrama than most romance novels. We follow Hayworth's life from reluctant child performer to incest victim, glamour queen and wife to Orson Welles and Prince Aly Kahn. Some readers will doubtless appreciate the details of the star's sex life and inner thoughts ("as her wedding day approached, Rita grew more anxious"). Yet aside from interviews with Welles, the book is based on secondary sources and information furnished by Hayworth's secretary, publicist, studio hairdresser and makeup man. As her chronicled fights with Columbia Pictures mogul Harry Cohn and court battles over divorce and child custody attest, fame and beauty assure no happy endings. Hayworth, a long-undiagnosed victim of Alzeimer's disease, died at age 68 in 1987. 50,000 first printing; first serial to Cosmopolitan and the Star; BOMC and Time/Life Condensed Books alternates; author tour. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Hayworth made her name in films such as Cover Girl and Gilda . She also attained fame and notoriety through her marriages to Orson Welles, Prince Aly Khan, and Dick Haymes, among others. Finally she became probably the best-known victim of Alzheimer's disease. Leaming, author of well-received biographies of Welles and Roman Polanski, contends that Hayworth was sexually abused by her father. Since both the principals, and Leaming's source, Orson Welles, are all dead, the truth will never be known, but she does make a reasonably convincing case.

Streamlined, &#34;hurricane-proof&#34; houses will pivot on their foundations like weather vanes. The family car will turn into an airplane so easily that &#34;a woman can do it in five minutes&#34;. Our wars will be fought by robots. And our living room furniture - waterproof, of course - will clean up with a squirt from the garden hose. In Yesterday&#39;s Tomorrows Joseph J. Corn and Brian Horrigan explore the future as Americans earlier in this century expected it to happen. Filled with vivid color images and lively text, the book is an eloquent testimony to the confidence - and, at times, the naive faith - Americans have had in science and technology. The future that emerges here, the authors conclude, is one in which technology changes, but society and politics usually do not. The authors draw on a wide variety of sources - popular-science magazines, science fiction, world fair exhibits, films, advertisements, and plans for things only dreamed of. From Jules Verne to the Jetsons, from a 500-passenger flying wing to an anti-aircraft flying buzz-saw, the vision of the future as seen through the eyes of the past demonstrates the play of the American imagination on the canvas of the future.<p><b>Joseph J.

Written especially for Kipling's own children, each enchanting myth is followed by a selection of the master storyteller's spirited poetry. <br></p><p>Puck of Pook&#39;s Hill and Rewards and Fairies are classic children&#39;s books which speak powerfully to adult readers. Una and Dan, performing a scene from A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream one Midsummer&#39;s Eve, accidentally summon Puck to a fairy ring near their Sussex home. Through Puck the children are witnesses to tales of English history, subtly called forth by Kipling&#39;s brilliant and fluid adventure writing. Kipling&#39;s historical imagination extends to a wide variety of stories, many of which blend the ghostly and the familiar, and often anticipate his later writing in their themes: a sense of loss and breakdown, but also healing. First published in magazines between 1906 and 1910, the stories were accompanied by some of Kipling&#39;s most famous poems, including &#39;If-&#39; and &#39;The Way through the Woods&#39;. This edition includes an introduction which dispels the myth that these stories are simply a nostalgic view of English history, discusses their relationship to other historical fiction, and relates them to Kipling&#39;s earlier and later writings.<p>Nobel Laureate Rudyard Kipling (1865&#x2013;1936) is best remembered for children's tales such as <i>The Jungle Book</i> as well as his poetry and stories about British soldiers in India, which include "Gunga Din" and <i>The Man Who Would Be King. </i>Kipling was enormously popular at the turn of the 20th century but his reputation declined with the change in attitude toward British imperialism. In recent years Kipling's works have found new acclaim as a vibrant source of literary and cultural history.</p></p><h2>Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder Mysteries)</h2><p>Matthew Scudder is finally leading a comfortable life. He's sober, he's married, and the state just gave him a private investigator's license. He's growing older, and he's even getting respectable.<p>And his town is mellowing, too. The crime rate's down and the stock market's up. Gentrification's prettying up the old neighborhood. The New York streets don't seem so mean anymore.</p><p>Then Scudder signs on to help his closest and most unlikely friend, the larger-than-life Hell's Kitchen hoodlum Mick Ballou. And all hell breaks loose.</p><p>Scudder finds out he's not so respectable after all. He learns the spruced-up sidewalks of New York are as mean as they ever were, dark and gritty and stained with blood. And he discovers he's living in a world where the past is a minefield, the present is a war zone, and the future's an open question.

Matt Scudder, in his 14th appearance, is as sharp and entertaining as he is in such mysteries as <i>Eight Million Ways to Die</i> and <i>A Dance at the Slaughterhouse</i>. Scudder is one of the few dicks out there with a fully fleshed-out personality; he's not insensitive to the mayhem around him, and his fears are well founded and realistic. After all, as the title boldly states, we live in a world where everybody dies.<p> Settled into married life, sober, and finally a legit private eye (the state granted his license), Scudder is prepared to become a respectable high-priced detective working for New York City lawyers. But when his old buddy, Mick Ballou, comes to him because two of his runners end up murdered, Scudder finds himself sinking back into the muck of the underworld. While dodging thugs who are out to put a stop to his investigation, Scudder must figure out who has it in for Ballou.</p><p> The writing in this novel is elegant--equally supple in describing the gibbous moon as it is in sorting out Scudder's feelings on the murder of a close friend, or when recounting a rather gory eye plucking. The dialogue is snappy and true to life. Lawrence Block once again proves he's worthy of the title Grand Master of Mystery. So be sure to set aside a chunk of time before you sit down to read this novel, because you're not going to be able to tear yourself away. <i>--Jenny Brown</i></p>Matt Scudder is finally leading a comfortable life.

The New York streets don't look so mean anymore.<p>Then all hell breaks loose.</p><p>Scudder quickly discovers the spruced-up sidewalks are as mean as ever, dark and gritty and stained with blood. He's living in a world where the past is a minefield, the present is a war zone, and the future's an open question.

We see women boycotting British goods in the years before independence, writing propaganda that radicalized their neighbors, raising funds for the army, and helping finance the fledgling government. We see how they managed farms, plantations, and businesses while their men went into battle, and how they served as nurses and cooks in the army camps, risked their lives seeking personal freedom from slavery, and served as spies, saboteurs, and warriors. <br><br>She introduces us to sixteen-year-old Sybil Ludington, who sped through the night to rouse the militiamen needed to defend Danbury, Connecticut; to Phillis Wheatley, literary prodigy and Boston slave, who voiced the hopes of African Americans in poems; to Margaret Corbin, crippled for life when she took her husband&#x2019;s place beside a cannon at Fort Monmouth; to the women who gathered firewood, cooked, cleaned for the troops, nursed the wounded, and risked their lives carrying intelligence and participating in reconnaissance missions. Here, too, are Abigail Adams, Deborah Franklin, Lucy Knox, and Martha Washington, who lived with the daily knowledge that their husbands would be hanged as traitors if the revolution did not succeed. A recapturing of the experiences of ordinary women who lived in extraordinary times, and a fascinating addition to our understanding of the birth of our nation.</p><p>Carol Berkin, professor of American history at Baruch College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, is the author of <i>A Brilliant Solution: Inventing the American Constitution, First Generations, </i>and<i> Jonathan Sewall</i>. She lives in New York City.Chapter One<br>"The Easy Task of Obeying"<br><br>There is a story told of John Winthrop, the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. One day in 1645, Governor Edward Hopkins of Connecticut consulted his friend Winthrop. Hopkins was greatly distressed, for his wife appeared to have completely lost her senses. Insanity had set in--without warning, he reported, and without apparent cause. Winthrop, however, instantly knew the origins of the woman's madness: reading books. "If she had attended her household affairs and such things as belong to women, and not gone out of her way and calling to meddle in such things as are proper to men, whose minds are stronger, etc.," he explained, then she might have "kept her wits."<br> <br>Few educated men of the following century would have made such a demeaning statement about a woman's intellect. Yet an equally small number were ready to concede that women, as much as men, had the capacity for rigorous formal education or political decision making. The philosophers of the Enlightenment, whose works were so popular among the eighteenth-century colonial leadership, might insist that all humans had the ability to reason, but not even the most radical of these philosophers suggested that the fairer sex had abilities equal to those of men.<br> <br>This debate over women's capacities was theoretical, of course, and few colonists, male or female, had the time or inclination to engage in it. Most colonial men and women--like most ordinary Americans today--took the gendered world as they found it, and, although what they found varied with social class and region, certain truths seemed too obvious to debate. Chief among a woman's truths was that God had created her to be a helpmate to man and Nature had formed her for this purpose. Her natural inclination was to obedience, fidelity, industriousness, and frugality and her natural function was bearing and nurturing children. From childhood, a woman heard her destiny as helpmate confirmed and affirmed by the authorities who peopled her world. Ministers sermonized it, educators elaborated it, lawmakers codified it, and poets versified it. From a pulpit in Massachusetts, the Puritan divine Cotton Mather urged a woman to be an "Ornament of Zion" by "look[ing] upon [a husband] as her guide" and recognizing that husband and wife are "but one mind in two bodies." In his 1712 book, The Well Ordered Family, the scholar Benjamin Wadsworth reminded women that God had made Eve as a helpmate to Adam and that the apostles required "wives be faithful in all things, keepers of the home." From the pages of his treatise Baron and Feme, Samuel Chase declared that "the law of nature has put [a wife] under the obedience of her husband," and the law of man must be made to agree. And, in his epic poem Paradise Lost, John Milton summed up the relationship between a husband and wife in an epigram of hierarchy: "He for God only / She for God in him."2<br> <br>Thus, through precept, law, and custom, English society established the acceptable parameters of women's lives, just, of course, as it established those of men. On the whole, however, a woman's life was dominated by negatives. Born rich or poor, a woman faced restrictions on her economic independence, her legal identity, and her access to positions of formal authority. These restrictions nudged, or pushed, a woman into the narrow choice of marriage or spinsterhood. Colonial inheritance laws, drawn from English law, ensured her economic dependency, for sons were given land while daughters had to be content with movable property. Land ownership in colonial America defined a man as an independent citizen; the possession of cattle, slaves, and household goods defined a woman as a traveler from her father's house to her husband's. Sons might be apprenticed to learn skilled trades, brought into family businesses, or sent to college, but custom barred women from most crafts and the lingering belief that the female brain was too weak to absorb abstract ideas barred them from all but the most elementary education. Closed out of professions such as law and the ministry, landless, and with few acceptable occupations outside the household, most women who did not marry faced bleak futures as dependents in the homes of their parents or married sisters.<br> <br>Spinsterhood was more than a life of dependency. It was more than a mark of rejection, a sign that men found a woman, in the blunt language of New England, a "thornback." Without a husband, a woman remained in limbo between childhood and adulthood, for English colonial society offered her no other rites of passage but marriage and motherhood. While men could chart their maturity by the call to militia service, by voting and perhaps office holding, by positions of honor within the church, or by landownership, all these public venues of responsibility were closed to women.<br> <br>Marriage had its costs as well. As a feme sole, or woman alone, a colonial woman had access to a broader legal identity than she would as a matron. A feme sole could sue and be sued, earn what wages she could, buy and sell property, and will her assets to her heirs. Without these legal rights, a woman without family support would have become a burden on the state. Yet once a woman married, English society saw no need for her to enjoy these rights. In her new status as feme covert, or woman covered, all that she owned became her husband's property, even the clothes on her back. The noted English jurist Blackstone wrote lyrically of this deprivation, assuring new husbands that "by marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law: that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage, or at least is incorporated and consolidated into that of the husband" and reassuring new wives that they were secure under their husbands' "wing, protection, and cover."3 In exchange for this complete surrender, the law guaranteed her dower rights, declaring that in widowhood she would have the use, though not the actual ownership, of one-third of her husband's property. Women might cherish dower rights as recognition of their contribution to the family welfare, but colonial governments saw this provision in more practical terms. A woman's "thirds" protected the state from the burden of caring for an aging woman or a young widow with children. If the law rendered a wife dependent, it also required a man to support her from the grave.<br> <br>Colonial society ensured that women's identity was synonymous with the roles they played: wife and mother. Yet society could not ensure that the what and how of these roles remained uniform or constant. As the circumstances of women's lives grew more varied, the content of the roles changed. As cities grew, women adapted the repertoire of household skills to fit their urban lives. As social distinctions hardened, women of the upper classes adopted behavior that distinguished them from their poorer neighbors. Yet no matter how different the what and how, the why remained the same: women were helpmates to men.<br> <br>In the seventeenth century, when the colonies were overwhelmingly rural and agricultural, the traditional skills a woman brought to the marriage--a repertoire of domestic manufacturing and processing skills--were essential to the success of the family. Her domain was the household, the garden, and the henhouse, and her days were spent processing the raw materials her husband produced into usable items such as food, clothing, candles, and soap. In this environment, a woman's fertility was as vital as her productivity, for children were an essential labor force on small farms throughout the colonies. Seventeenth-century gravestones and eulogies attested to the value placed on motherhood. Thus, women who hoped to gain renown in their small rural communities had to demonstrate a lifelong commitment to industry, frugality, and fecundity.<br> <br>Rural housewives had little time for activities that the modern reader associates with housework: cleaning, dusting, polishing, and decorating. But in the colonial cities of the eighteenth century, among the growing ranks of prosperous mercantile families, these tasks now defined women's work. A consumer revolution--with its availability of cheap English cloth and the influx of luxury items that were now within the reach of the wealthy merchant or lawyer--had freed elite urban women from most production tasks. Able to purchase many of the goods their grandmothers had once made, these women turned their energies and attention to the refinement of their homes and of their families. With slaves or servants to assist them, and with greengrocers and bakers and seamstresses to supply their cupboards and their wardrobes, these "pretty gentlewomen," as one historian has called them, focused on the beautification of their homes and the genteel upbringing of their daughters. Along with this new set of chores came a new code of behavior, a new definition of femininity. Industry and frugality gave way to delicacy, refinement, and an attention to fashion. This new focus on gentility among the urban elite eliminated many housewifely activities, yet it also added others. Although they no longer churned butter or slaughtered pigs, these privileged women adopted a set of maintenance chores. Cleanliness became a mark of urban sophistication, and even when servants or slaves performed the unpleasant tasks of scouring, laundering, and polishing, the burden of ensuring an attractive domestic environment fell squarely upon their mistresses.4<br> <br>Many women found themselves caught between the older ideal of "notable housewife" and the newer ideal of "pretty gentlewoman," and thus shouldering the burdens of gentility and the burdens of traditional housewifery. Thus, in addition to planting her garden and pickling her beef, Mary Holyoke, the wife of a prosperous country doctor, felt compelled to scour the pewter and hang pictures. In her daybook, Holyoke carefully recorded her w...</p><h2>The Clockwork Scarab: A Stoker &amp; Holmes Novel (Stoker &amp; Holmes, 1)</h2><p><b>Evaline Stoker and Mina Holmes never meant to get into the family business.</b> But when you're the sister of Bram and the niece of Sherlock, vampire hunting and mystery solving are in your blood, so to speak.

Stoker &amp; Holmes is her first series for young adults. She lives in Michigan.Gr 8 Up&#x2013;This book has it all: plot, setting, character development. An alternate, steampunk version of 19th-century London is the setting for this first title of a proposed series. Reluctantly at first, Mina Holmes, the teenage niece of Sherlock Holmes, and Evaline Stoker, the teenage sister of Bram Stoker, combine their sleuthing and hand-to-hand combat talents to find out why society girls are turning up dead. As the pair infiltrates opium dens, pubs, society balls, and seedy criminal lairs, they discover that a secret society based on Egyptology is at the heart of the bad business. As the teens get closer to the truth, they get closer to being counted among those killed. Holmes, highly logical and serious, comes across as aloof, even a bit of a snob. However, readers come to discover that she uses her snobbishness as protection. At heart, she is insecure about her looks and worries about what guys think of her. Stoker, a pretty and vivacious vampire hunter, is brave and strong, but she, too, has her vulnerabilities. Throughout their adventure, they have the help (and admiration) of mysterious, possibly criminal, Pix; intelligent Inspector Grayling; and accidental time-traveler Dylan. Sherlock Holmes and Bram Stoker add familiar excitement with their cameo appearances. All in all, the vivid setting and the finely drawn, compelling heroines make this a fine choice for readers who like their stories with steampunk spice and smart, strong women.&#x2013;Jennifer Prince, Buncombe County Public Libraries, NC&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

With lyrical precision, psychological directness, resonating symbolic power, and a rage that is at once unrelenting and compassionate, Baldwin chronicles a fourteen-year-old boy's discovery of the terms of his identity as the stepson of the minister of a storefront Pentecostal church in Harlem one Saturday in March of 1935. Baldwin's rendering of his protagonist's spiritual, sexual, and moral struggle of self-invention opened new possibilities in the American language and in the way Americans understand themselves.</p><p>First published in 1953 when James Baldwin was nearly 30, <i>Go Tell It on the Mountain</i> is a young man's novel, as tightly coiled as a new spring, yet tempered by a maturing man's confidence and empathy. It's not a long book, and its action spans but a single day--yet the author packs in enough emotion, detail, and intimate revelation to make his story feel like a mid-20th-century epic. Using as a frame the spiritual and moral awakening of 14-year-old John Grimes during a Saturday night service in a Harlem storefront church, Baldwin lays bare the secrets of a tormented black family during the depression. John's parents, praying beside him, both wrestle with the ghosts of their sinful pasts--Gabriel, a preacher of towering hypocrisy, fathered an illegitimate child during his first marriage down South and refused to recognize his doomed bastard son; Elizabeth fell in love with a charming, free-spirited young man, followed him to New York, became pregnant with his son, and lost him before she could reveal her condition. <p> Baldwin lays down the terrible symmetries of these two blighted lives as the ironic context for John's dark night of the soul. When day dawns, John believes himself saved, but his creator makes it clear that this salvation arises as much from blindness as revelation: "He was filled with a joy, a joy unspeakable, whose roots, though he would not trace them on this new day of his life, were nourished by the wellspring of a despair not yet discovered." </p><p> Though it was hailed at publication for its groundbreaking use of black idiom, what is most striking about <i>Go Tell It on the Mountain</i> today is its structure and its scope. In peeling back the layers of these damaged lives, Baldwin dramatizes the story of the great black migration from rural South to urban North. "Behind them was the darkness," Baldwin writes of Gabriel and Elizabeth's lost generation, "nothing but the darkness, and all around them destruction, and before them nothing but the fire--a bastard people, far from God, singing and crying in the wilderness!" This is Baldwin's music--a music in which rhapsody is rooted anguish--and there is none finer in American literature. <i>--David Laskin</i></p>James Baldwin's stunning first novel is now an American classic. With startling realism that brings Harlem and the black experience vividly to life, this is a work that touches the heart with emotion while it stimulates the mind with its narrative style, symbolism, and excoriating vision of racism in America. Moving through time from the rural South to the northern ghetto, starkly contrasting the attitudes of two generations of an embattles family, <i>Go Tell It On The Mountain</i> is an unsurpassed portrayal of human beings caught up in a dramatic struggle and of a society confronting inevitable change. <p>"The most important novel written about the American Negro," says <i>Commentary</i>. "It is written with poetic intensity and great narrative skill," writes <i>Harper's</i>. <i>Saturday Review</i> praises it as "masterful," and the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> declares that this important American novel is "brutal, objective and compassionate."</p></p><h2>The Westing Game (Isis Large Print for Children Cornerstone)</h2><p>The mysterious death of an eccentric millionaire brings together an unlikely assortment of heirs who must uncover the circumstances of his death before they can claim their inheritance.</p><p>Ellen Raskin was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and grew up during the Great Depression.

And until 1969, I didn&#x2019;t really know her, although when I was the children&#x2019;s-book editor at Holt, Rinehart and Winston, she had illustrated <i>Books: A Book to Begin On,</i> by Susan Bartlett, and <i>Come Along!</i>, by Rebecca Caudill&#x2014;as well as doing for us some of the one thousand book jackets of which she was so proud.</p><p>Our friendship really began in the smoking car (like the title character of <i>Moe Q. McGlutch</i>, Ellen smoked too much) of a Pennsylvania Railroad train en route from New York to Philadelphia, where we were both speaking on a panel. I stopped to say hello, and she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sitting here alone because I&#x2019;m so nervous. I hate speaking.&#x201d; &#x201c;I hate it, too,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;and I&#x2019;ve given up smoking.&#x201d; In the depressed gloom that followed this exchange, the beginning of a bond was formed.</p><p>That same year I moved from Holt to E. P. Dutton. Their office was located at Union Square and Seventeenth Street, only a short walk from Ellen&#x2019;s apartment on Eighth Street, and we got together more often. One day, Ellen confided that she had always wanted to adapt <i>Goblin Market,</i> by Christina Rossetti, as a picture-book text. I thought of the lavishly rich visual details of the poem, and I longed to see how she would illustrate it. &#x201d;Would you do the book for me?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she answered. &#x201c;Jean [Jean Karl, her editor at Atheneum] doesn&#x2019;t want it.&#x201d; Ellen was always candid. So she did do it&#x2014;her first book for Dutton. One of her exquisitely intricate paintings for that book now hangs on my wall.</p><p>We often talked about our lives, and I particularly loved stories about her family and how she and her parents and sister drove around the country during the Great Depression so her father could look for work, an epic safari that took them from Milwaukee to California. &#x201c;You should write a book about growing up in the Depression,&#x201d; I told her.</p></p><h2>Prayers for Sale</h2><p><br><br>Hennie Comfort is eighty-six and has lived in the mountains of Middle Swan, Colorado since before it was Colorado.&nbsp; Nit Spindle is just seventeen and newly married.&nbsp; She and her husband have just moved to the high country in search of work.&nbsp; It's 1936 and the depression has ravaged the country and Nit and her husband have suffered greatly.&nbsp; Hennie notices the young woman loitering near the old sign outside of her house that promises "Prayers For Sale".&nbsp; Hennie doesn't sell prayers, never has, but there's something about the young woman that she's drawn to.&nbsp; The harsh conditions of life that each have endured create an instant bond and an unlikely friendship is formed, one in which the deepest of&nbsp;hardships&nbsp;are shared&nbsp;and the darkest of secrets are confessed.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br><br>Sandra Dallas has created an unforgettable tale of&nbsp;a friendship between two women, one with surprising twists and turns, and one that is ultimately a revelation of the&nbsp;finest parts of the human spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br>Award-winning author Sandra Dallas was dubbed &#x201c;a quintessential American voice&#x201d; by Jane Smiley, in <i>Vogue</i> Magazine.&nbsp;She is the author of <i>The Bride&#x2019;s House, Whiter Than Snow</i>, and <i>Tallgrass</i>, among others. Her novels have been translated into a dozen languages and optioned for films. She is the recipient of the Women Writing the West Willa Award and the two-time winner of the Western Writers of America Spur Award. For 25 years, Dallas worked as a reporter covering the Rocky Mountain region for <i>Business Week</i>, and started writing fiction in 1990. She lives with her husband in Denver, Colorado.<br>PRAYERS FOR SALE (Chapter 1)<p>The old woman peered past the red geraniums in her deep front window at the figure lingering in the moon-white snow at the gate. In the gloom of the late winter afternoon, Hennie Comfort did not recognize the woman, who stood like a curious bird, her head cocked to one side as she looked at the fence, then the front door, and back at the fence again. Hennie watched, thinking it odd that anyone would wait there, mute as the snow itself. Why would a body stand in the cold when she could come inside by the stove?</p><p>Hennie had gone to the window to read her letter in the winter light, because the heavy snow had weighted down the wires, causing the electric to go out. It was too dark inside now to read, although Hennie knew the words wouldn't be any different from what they were when she read the letter at the post office that morning.</p><p>For years, Mae had urged her to move out of the high country. This time, she'd made it plain that if Hennie insisted on another winter on the earth's backbone, Mae would come to Middle Swan herself and pack up her mother and take her below, to Fort Madison on the eastern edge of Iowa. Mae was a loving daughter, but she was as stubborn as Hennie. "You can spend your summers in Middle Swan, Mom, but I insist that from now on, you live with us during the winters. What if you slipped on the ice and broke your leg? You could freeze to death before somebody found you."</p><p>Mae was right, Hennie admitted to herself. If she fell, the snow would cover her up, and nobody would know where she was until she melted out in the spring. It was foolhardy for a person as old as she was to stay another winter on the Swan River. Besides, it was selfish of her to let Mae worry, and Hennie was always sensible of the feelings of others. But Lordy, she didn't want to live on the Mississippi.</p><p>Hennie set the letter on the table and returned to the window to look at the woman, covered now in white flakes. She'd be frozen solid as a fence post if she didn't move soon. So the old woman opened the door and walked into the snow in her stout shoes, her hands tucked into her sleeves. "Hello to you," she called.</p><p>The stranger looked up, startled, a little frightened. She was a new-made woman, not much more than a girl, and Hennie had never seen her before. "Oh!" the stranger said, clasping and unclasping her bare hands, which despite the poor light, Hennie could see were red and chapped. "I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering how much?"</p><p>"How much for what?"</p><p>"A prayer." The girl tightened the triangle of plaid wool scarf that covered her head before she thrust her hands into the pockets of her thin coat.</p><p>Hennie was confused for a moment, and then realizing what had confounded the girl, she laughed. "That sign's been there so long, I forget about it."</p><p>"It says, Prayers for Sale. I'm asking how much do you charge, and is it more if you're in need than if you're wanting just a little favor? Do sinners pay more than the righteous? And what if the Lord doesn't answer? Do you get your money back?" The girl asked all this in a rush, as if she didn't want to forget any of the questions she had pondered as she stood frozen-still in the cold.</p><p>"That sign's older than God's old dog."</p><p>"How come you to sell prayers?"</p><p>"I don't."</p><p>"The sign says so. I've seen it three times now. I came back because of it," the girl persisted. "I can pay, if that's what you're thinking. I can pay."</p><p>Hennie chuckled. "That sign's a story. I'll tell it to you if you'll come inside."</p><p>"I've got a nickel. Is that enough for a prayer?"</p><p>"Lordy, are you needing one? No money will buy a prayer, I tell you, but I'll give you one for free, if you're in need of it." Hennie put her arms tight around herself to squeeze out the cold, for she had gone into the storm without her coat.</p><p>"I need it. I do."</p><p>"Just you come inside then and tell me why."</p><p>"I can't. I've got to get home and fix Dick's supper. But I'd be obliged to you if you'd say a prayer--a prayer for Sweet Baby Effie, sweet baby that was, that is. Maybe you could ask that wherever she is, she's not taken with the cold--I never knew it to be so cold--but just any words will do."</p><p>"I'll ask it," Hennie said, turning and gesturing toward the house, but the girl wouldn't follow. Instead, she took a step backward.</p><p>"I thank you," she said, carefully laying her nickel on the crosspiece of the fence. Then she turned and fled. Rubbing her arms now against the cold, Hennie watched until the little thing disappeared into the storm. Then she picked up the five-cent piece and went inside, placing the coin in a mite box that she kept for Bonnie Harvey to take to church. Hennie herself didn't attend services, hadn't in a long time.</p><p>As she sat down in a kitchen chair, Hennie picked up the letter, but instead of holding it up to the window to read again, she pondered the young girl. Something about her was familiar, although Hennie was sure she'd never seen her before. It might have been the way she said her words, which told Hennie she was from the South. Or perhaps it was because the girl was new in Middle Swan and appeared to be not a day older than Hennie herself when she'd arrived long years before.</p><p>Hennie looked out the window again, but there was no sign of the girl returning, no sign that she'd even been there, in fact. The old woman wondered why the girl wanted a prayer; she seemed to have a powerful desire for one. Well, Hennie knew the need for prayer in her life, and she would do what she could. So slowly, she knelt on her old knees beside the chair, clasped her hands together, and asked God to keep Sweet Baby Effie warm. Then she mumbled, "Now, Lord, there's a girl, a poor girl, by the looks of her, that's needing your help--and maybe mine, too. I'd like it right well if you could tell me what to do." She paused and added, "And I'd be grateful if you'd find a way short of dying to keep me from moving in with Mae."</p><p>"You've got it pretty good here," Hennie Comfort said, looking around the room with approval. She ducked her head as she went through the door to Nit's cabin, not only because she was a tall woman, even in old age, but because the doorway was that low.</p><p>Rooted to the ground, the cabin, built of peeled logs polished by the sun and wind and snow to a rich gold-brown, was ramshackled outside. Within, there was only one room, and that not much bigger than a coal shed, with a door and a window that held four panes of glass. But the place was tidy, cozy even. A rag rug covered the worn linoleum that was ribbed from the uneven floorboards beneath it. The log walls had been freshly chinked and papered with the <i>Denver Post</i>, the pages right side up so that you could read them at your leisure. A bed was shoved against one wall. The tops of its tall wooden head- and footboards pressed in on each other, making the mattress sag even more than it would have if the boards had been upright. The bed was Dionysius Tappan's old bed. He'd died in it, wheezing and blowing with the miner's puff, and then the cabin had sat vacant until the young couple moved in.</p><p>The pretty girl ought to have a better bed, Hennie thought. But young folks who hadn't been married long wouldn't worry so much about a good bed. They might even feel lucky that they had a place to sleep, what with this being 1936 and a depression not likely to end soon. The girl had spread a quilt over the mattress, a patch quilt in gay colors that would brighten the long winters. A second quilt, a design of eight-pointed stars, newly made with new and old fabrics, was folded over a wooden bench. Hennie was always sensible of the quilts.</p><p>A pie safe, the green paint half worn off its tin panels, stood near the cookstove, and a crude split-bottom rocking chair, once painted blue, sat in the far corner. The only other furniture in the room was a small table and two dynamite boxes that served as chairs. The girl's husband--she'd said his name was Dick when the two had met outside Hennie's house a few days earlier--must have picked them up at the gold dredge company. "Pretty good, all right," Hennie said again.</p><p>"It's a gem of amber," the girl replied. She clasped and unclasped her hands in delight. "Would you sit?"</p><p>"If it wouldn't put you out any," Hennie replied.</p><p>"Oh no. I'm starved for company. I get so lonesome. But my hand had an itch to it this morning, so I knew I'd be shaking hands with a stranger. You're my only caller--that is, my first caller. I guess there'll be others .&nbsp;.&nbsp;." Her voice trailed off.</p><p>"I reckon so. Not many know you're here yet. I didn't myself till you stopped at my fence." After meeting the girl in the snow, Hennie had inquired at the Pinto store about the new couple.</p><p>"They live in the Tappan place. I don't recollect the name. He works the dredge," Roy Pinto had told her. Then he'd shaken his head. "There's some in Middle Swan that resent him getting hired on. They're out to get him. Besides, he's not stout enough for dredge work." Not many were, Hennie had replied.</p><p>Hennie gave the girl her name and said she lived at the end of French Street, in the two-story hewn-log house, just before the road turned to go up to the old We Got 'Em mine. Hardly anybody remembered the We Got 'Em, but Hennie liked to say the name. She remembered when Chauncy Stark had come running down the trail yelling, "We got 'em, gold ore like you never saw." "But you know where I live," Hennie told the girl.</p><p>The young thing nodded and said, "I'm Nit Buckley .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that is, Nit Spindle. I haven't been married very long, not even two years, and sometimes I forget I'm married. I mean, I'm glad, because I love Dick and all, but it still seems strange to be somebody's missus instead of me."</p><p>"Pleased to meet you again, Mrs. Spindle," Hennie said. "I gave the prayer like you asked, gave it more than once." When the girl turned away, embarrassed, mumbling her thanks, Hennie knew she'd have to wait until Nit felt like talking about the prayer, if she ever did. It wouldn't do for Hennie to push the girl just to satisfy an old woman's curiosity. So instead, she drew the clean dishcloth off the top of the pie she was holding and presented the dessert. "This pie's nothing special, but it'll do you if you're hungry." In fact, the pie was a thing of beauty, with a perfect crust, pinched around the edges, the latticework woven, not just laid on, and it was stained red where the juice had seeped onto it. "It's a welcome-to-home present," she added quickly, in case the girl thought she was bringing charity. There'd been that other young couple on the Upper Swan who'd lived on a little flour and porcupine meat, too proud to accept help. They wouldn't take relief even from the county. Those two had nearly starved before somebody took them down below where they'd come from. "I bottled the raspberries last summer," Hennie continued. "Picked them myself up by that burned place that's under the saddle on Sunset Peak, before the bears got to them. The bears are harbonated still, and so are the raspberries. Fresh raspberries, now that's the best eating there is, might near be."</p><p>Nit's eyes widened as she took the pie and set it reverently on the shelf of the range. "Thanks to you. I'll return the compliment someday," she said. "I'm glad it's not pieplant. I don't love pieplant. I just don't love it. But I've always been a fool all my life about raspberries. I never expected to find them here. I mean now, that is, this time of year."</p><p>"I'll take you raspberrying come summer. I know the best places all around. You can find rhubarb just anywhere. All you have to do is look for an old cabin. But like you say, you don't just love it." Hennie took off her heavy wraps and laid them on the bed, before she seated herself slowly on one of the boxes. "I ought to know the place for raspberrying. Almost seventy years have I been living in Middle Swan." She didn't add that this might be the last year. Although Mae had written that Hennie could spend her summers in Middle Swan, the old woman was afraid that once she was settled in Iowa, she'd most likely stay put. Mae would find reasons for her not to return to the high country. Hennie reminded herself that if she was ever to deal with her life's deepest secret, she'd have to do it soon.</p><p>"Seventy years? Why, I didn't know Colorado'd been here that long." Nit flushed and bit her lip, looking anxious for fear she'd given offense.</p><p>Hennie only laughed. "It hasn't. But I have. I'm almost as old as these hills--eighty and six." She didn't look it. Oh, her skin was brown from years of living too close to the sun, and her hair was the color of the snow that had fallen for days now. But there was a toughness and sense of purpose to Hennie Comfort that belied her age. And while she'd never been pretty, she had been handsome and still was, with her tall angular body, her large mouth and straight nose set in a long face. She sat upright, her back straight as a pine, not stooped like most mountain women.</p><p>Nit stared at Hennie, about to say something but too tongue-tied. She shook her curls and said at last, "We've got coffee, the grounds not used but once."</p><p>"I'll take a cup if it wouldn't rob you."</p><p>"No, ma'am. It would not." Nit turned quickly and busied herself at the range, putting kindling into the firebox, watching the fire flare up, adjusting the damper, then adding stove wood. After she dipped water from a bucket and poured it into the cast-iron tea kettle, fitting the kettle into the eye over the firebox, the girl lifted down a basket and took out a bundle wrapped in newspaper. She removed the paper to display two fine teacups and saucers, which she polished with a dish towel before setting them on the table.</p><p>"Oh my, real English bone china," Hennie said.</p><p>"Sometimes I'm afraid to use them. They're delicate as birds' eggs, and I've got nary another. But you're my first caller." She paused. "I guess I already said that."</p><p>Hennie wanted to tell the girl that cracked mugs would do for her, but seeing Nit's pride, she said instead, "I thank you for the honor."</p><p>"I didn't mean you'd break them." Nit turned back to the stove and spooned the used grounds into the coffeepot, then added a spoonful of fresh. She poured boiling water into the pot and let the coffee steep, the grounds settle. "I hope you don't think I'm putting on airs, Mrs. Comfort. The cups are a wedding present, and I love them so. I'm saving them for good, for callers such as yourself. Have you ever seen anything so pretty?"</p><p>A long-ago look came over Hennie Comfort's face. "Somebody gave me china cups as a wedding present, too. I was younger than you." The old woman had packed them in a barrel of flour for the trip to Colorado, and she had them yet, chipped and mended but still good enough to use.</p><p>Nit said she was seventeen. Small, with clear pink skin, her bobbed hair the color of the rust that covered Middle Swan's abandoned mining machinery like a patina, and wearing a prim little dress with cap sleeves and a sash, she was just a chunk of a girl.</p><p>Hennie told her she'd been fourteen, going on fifteen, when she'd married.</p><p>"It's old enough," Nit said.</p><p>"That was eighteen an...</p></p><h2>The Problem that Has No Name</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p></p><h2>Route 66 Barn Find Road Trip: Lost Collector Cars Along the Mother Road</h2><p><b>Abandoned cars on America's most iconic abandoned road.

In The Universe and the Teacup, K. C. Cole demystifies mathematics and shows us-with humor and wonderfully accessible stories-why math need not be frightening. Using the O. J. Simpson trial, the bell curve, and Emmy Noether, the nineteenth-century woman scientist whose work was essential for Einstein's theory of relativity, Cole helps us see that more than just being a tool, math is a key to understanding the beauty of everything from rainbows to relativity.<br></p><p>"Pure mathematics," <i>Albert Einstein</i> once remarked, "is, in its way, the poetry of logical ideas." In <i>The Universe and the Teacup</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i> science writer K. C. Cole discusses some of the ways this "poetry" can be used to look at science and other realms of experience.<p> Mathematics, Cole explains, enables us to "translate the complexity of the world into manageable patterns," whether we're trying to comprehend the risks of smoking or the usefulness of DNA matches in criminal investigations. Cole also looks at how mathematical principles apply in unexpected fields. One chapter, for example, vindicates the theories on voting rights that cost Lani Guinier her Justice Department nomination in 1993.</p><p> Without relying on a single equation, Cole's gently humorous prose helps make mathematics unthreatening to laypeople, enabling them to better understand the world in which they live.</p>A popular science columnist for the Los Angeles Times and teacher at UCLA, K.C. Cole is a recipient of the 1995 American Institute of Physics Award for Best Science Writing.

Margolyes breathes a bit of life into this predictable novel by Sally Beauman, lending a different voice to each character in its quiet seaside setting. But even Margolyes's great ability isn't enough to overcome the slow start to this story or the predictable melodrama that unfolds. Margolyes perfectly captures the mean spirit and drama behind Rebecca, the novel's focus, but the result is the listener's strong dislike for most of the characters involved. One wonders if the abridgment cut out any redeeming qualities of Rebecca and those around her. While Margolyes makes the story somewhat enjoyable with her talent for reading, it isn't enough to warrant a replay.

More than just interpreting it, he also separates stories that were combined by scribes centuries after they were written, explaining their sources and omitting all verses that are recognized as scribal additions. Like removing coat after coat of lacquer from a once-vibrant masterpiece, this allows readers to appreciate the clarity of the original tales.</p><p><em>Genesis</em> is an extraordinarily beautiful book that is accessible in a way that no other translation has ever been. It will shed new light on readers' understanding of this seminal work of sacred scripture. </p></p><p>Stephen Mitchell, author of <i>The Gospel According to Jesus</i> and a participant in Bill Moyer's PBS television series on Genesis, has produced a new translation of the Bible's first book. Mitchell's sensitivity to the original Hebrew language and the history of biblical scholarship is evident in his carefully written work. But it is his overwhelming concern with contemporary relevance that marks this translation. Those interested in new means of situating the spiritual message of Genesis will likely welcome Mitchell's phrasings and interpretations.Stephen Mitchell--who is widely known for <i>The Gospel According to Jesus</i> and his translations <i>of The Book of Job</i> and the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>--puts the great biblical stories of Genesis in a modern perspective.</p><h2>Rosa Lee: A Mother and Her Family in Urban America</h2><p>Based on a series of Pulitzer Prize-winning articles, this harrowing account of life in the urban underclass offers compelling testimony in the ongoing national debate about welfare reform.In Rosa Lee, Washington Post reporter Leon Dash vividly chronicles the hardships and pathologies of the daily life of a family in the slums of Washington, D.C. Defying simplistic conservative and liberal arguments about why the black underclass persists, Dash puts a human face on their struggle to survive despite both disastrous personal choices and almost insurmountable circumstances.The book spans a half-century of hardship, from Rosa Lee Cunningham?s bleak early life in the Jim Crow South to her death from AIDS at age fifty-nine. Rosa Lee gave birth to her first child at fourteen, was married at sixteen, and ultimately bore eight children whom she had no legitimate means of supporting. When her welfare checks proved insufficient to feed her family, she turned to prostitution and selling stolen clothes and drugs. Yet Rosa Lee maintained a flickering desire to do what was right. Two of her sons did escape the ghetto to enter mainstream life, and after Dash?s series of articles ran in The Washington Post, she made public speeches, hoping to encourage other people to avoid her destructive choices.Rosa Lee is the worthy successor to such works as Jonathan Kozol?s Death at an Early Age. It offers no easy answers, but is instead challenging, thought-provoking, and utterly unforgettable.</p><p>Drug-addled, welfare-using and AIDS-infected, Rosa Lee--a black woman living in the slums of Washington, D.C.--shines an enormous amount of light on the seemingly intractable problems of the underclass by allowing Leon Dash to tell her story. You won't find any diagrams or number-crunching in this book, just an absorbing tale of inner-city despair. Dash won the Pulitzer Prize for his series of articles on Rosa Lee for the <i>Washington Post</i>. The book is even better--easily the best of its type since Alex Kotlowitz's There Are No Children Here.Leon Dash won the Pulitzer Prize and the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for the series of articles upon which Rosa Lee is based.

You will not have to concern yourself with issues of loyalty once your vassal is incapable of disloyal contemplation. <p></p>-The Emperor Zul-torac, on the importance of reinforcing the Wyrmling Catechism on the youth <p></p>Cullossax the tormentor strode through the dark warrens of Rugassa, shoving lesser wyrmlings aside. None dared to snarl or raise a hand to stop him. Instead, the pale creatures cowered back in fear. He was imposing in part because of his bulk. At nine feet, Cullossax towered over all but even the largest wyrmlings. The bony plate that ran along his forehead was abnormally thick, and the horny nubs on his head were larger than most. He was broad of chest, and his canines hung well below his lower lip. All of these were signs to other wyrmlings that he was potentially a violent man. <p></p>But it was not his brutal appearance alone that won him deference. His black robes of office struck fear in the hearts of others, as did his bloodsoaked hands. <p></p>The labyrinth seemed alive with excitement. It coursed through Cullossax's veins, and thrummed through every taut muscle. He could see it in the faces of those that he passed, and hear it in their nervous voices. <p></p>Some had fear upon their faces, while others' fears deepened to dread. But some faces shone with wonder or hope, bloodlust or exultation. <p></p>It was a rare and heady combination. It was an exciting time to be alive. <p></p>Four days ago, a huge army had left Rugassa to destroy the last of the humans at Caer Luciare. The attack was to have begun that very night. Thus the hope upon the people's faces that, after a war that had raged for three thousand years, the last of their enemies would be gone. <p></p>But then two days past, everything had changed: a whole world had fallen from the sky, and when it struck, the worlds did not crash and break. Instead, they combined into one whole, a world that was new and different, a world that combined the magics and peoples of two worlds, sometimes in unexpected ways. <p></p>Mountains had fallen and rivers had flooded. Ancient forests suddenly sprouted outside the castle gate where none had stood before. There were reports of strange creatures in the land, and all was in chaos. <p></p>Now reports were coming from wyrmling outposts in every quarter: there was something new in the land-humans, smaller folk than those of Caer Luciare. If the reports could be believed, they lived by the millions in every direction. It was rumored that it was one of their own wizards who bound the world of the wyrmlings with their own. <p></p>Such power was cause enough for the wyrmling's nervousness. But there was also cause for celebration. <p></p>Within the past few hours, rumors had been screaming through the chain of command that the Great Wyrm itself had taken a new form and now walked the labyrinth, showing abilities that had never been dreamed, not even in wyrmling legend. <p></p>Strange times indeed. <p></p>The last battle against the human warrior clans had been fought. Caer Luciare had been taken. The human warriors had been slaughtered and routed. <p></p>The news was glorious. But the wyrmlings remained nervous, unsure what might happen next. They stood in small knots and gossiped when they should be working. Some were disobedient and needed to be brought back into line. <p></p>So Cullossax the tormentor was busy. <p></p>In dark corridors where only glow worms lit his way, he searched through the crï¿½che, where the scent of children mingled with mineral smells of the warren, until at last he found a teaching chamber with three silver stars above the door. <p></p>He did not call out at the door, but instead shoved it open. There, a dogmatist stood against a wall with his pupils, wyrmling children fifteen or sixteen years of age. Few of the children had begun to grow the horny nubs at their temples yet, and so they looked small and effeminate. <p></p>At the center of the room, a single young girl was chained by the ankle to an iron rung in the floor. She had a desk-a few planks lying upon an iron frame. But instead of sitting at her desk, she crouched beneath it, moaning and peering away distantly, as if lost in some dream. She rocked back and forth as she moaned. <p></p>She was a pretty girl, by wyrmling standards. All wyrmlings had skin that was faintly bioluminescent, and children, with their excess energy, glowed strongly, while those who were ancient, with their leathery skin, faded altogether. This girl was a bright one, with silky white hair, innocent eyes, a full round face, and breasts that had already fully blossomed. <p></p>"She refuses to sit," said the dogmatist, a stern old man of sixty years. "She refuses to take part in class. When we recite the catechisms, she mouths the words. When we examine the policies, she will not answer questions." <p></p>"How long has she been like this?" the tormentor asked. <p></p>"For two days now," the dogmatist said. "I have berated her and beaten her, but still she refuses to cooperate." <p></p>"Yet she gave you no trouble before?" <p></p>"None," the dogmatist admitted. <p></p>It was the tormentor's job to dole out punishment, to do it thoroughly and dispassionately. Whether that punishment be public strangulation, or dismemberment, or some other torture, it did not matter. <p></p>Surely, this could not go on. <p></p>Cullossax knelt beside the girl, studied the child. There had to be a punishment. But Cullossax did not have to dole out the ultimate penalty. <p></p>"You must submit," Cullossax said softly, dangerously. "Society has a right to protect itself from the individual. Surely you see the wisdom in this?" <p></p>The girl rolled her eyes and peered away, as if carried to some faraway place in her imagination. She scratched at her throat, near a pendant made from a mouse's skull. Cullossax had seen too many like her in the past couple of days, people who chose to turn their faces to the wall and die. Beating her would not force her to submit. Nor would anything else. He would probably have to kill her, and that was a waste. This was a three-star school, the highest level. This girl had potential. So before the torments began, he decided to try reasoning with her. <p></p>"What are you thinking?" Cullossax demanded, his voice soft and deep. "Are you remembering something? Are you remembering . . . another place?" That caught the girl. She turned her head slowly, peered into Cullossax's eyes. "Yes," she whimpered, giving out a soft sob, then she began shaking in fear. "What do you remember?" Cullossax demanded. <p></p>"My life before," the child said. "I remember walking under green fields in the starlight. I lived with my mother there, and two sisters, and we raised pigs and kept a garden. The place we lived in was called Inkarra." <p></p>Just like so many others. This was the third today to name that place. <p></p>Each of them had spoken of it the same, as if it were a place of longing. Each of them hated their life in Rugassa. <p></p>It was the binding, of course. Cullossax was only beginning to understand, but much had changed when the two worlds were bound into one. <p></p>Children like this girl claimed to recall another life on that other world, a world where children were not kept in cages, a world where harsh masters did not make demands of them. They all dreamed of returning. <p></p>"It is all a dream," Cullossax said, hoping to convince her. "It isn't real. There is no place where children play free of fear. There is only here and now. You must learn to be responsible, to give away your own selfish desires. <p></p>"If you continue to resist," Cullossax threatened, "you know what I must do. When you reject society, you remove yourself from it. This cannot be tolerated, for then you are destined to become a drain upon society, not a contributor. <p></p>"Society has the right, and the duty, to protect itself from the individual." Normally, at this time, Cullossax would afflict the subject. Sometimes the very threat of torment would strike enough fear into the heart of the reprobate that she would do anything to prove her obedience. But Cullossax had discovered over the past two days that these children were not likely to submit at all. <p></p>"What shall I do with you?" Cullossax asked. <p></p>The girl was shaking still, speechless with terror. <p></p>"Who is society?" she asked suddenly, as if she had come upon a plan to win some leniency. <p></p>"Society consists of all of the individuals that make up the whole," Cullossax said, quoting from the catechisms that the child was to be studying. <p></p>"But which one of the people makes up the rules?" she asked. "Which one of them says that I must die if I do not follow the rules?" <p></p>"All of them," Cullossax answered reasonably. But he knew that that was not true. <p></p>The girl caught him in his lie. "The catechisms say that 'Right acts follow from right thinking.' 'But youth and stupidity are barriers to right thinking. Thus, we must submit to those who are wiser than we.' 'Ultimately the emperor, by virtue of the great immortal wyrm that lives within him, is wisest of all.' " <p></p>Wyrmling education consisted of rote memorization of the catechisms, not upon learning the skills of reading and writing. The wyrmlings had found that forcing children to memorize the words verbatim trained their minds well, and in time led to an almost infallible memory. This girl had strung together some catechisms in order to form the core of an argument. Now she asked her question: "So if the emperor is wisest, does not the emperor make the rules, rather than the collective group?" <p></p>"Some might say so," Cullossax admitted. <p></p>"The catechisms say, 'Men exist to serve the empire,' " the girl said. "But it seems to me that the emperor's teachings lead us to serve only him." <p></p>Cullossax knew blasphemy when he heard it. He answered in catechisms: <p></p>" 'Each serves society to the best of his ability, the emperor as well as the least serf,' " Cullossax reasoned. " 'By serving the emperor, we serve the great wyrm that resides within him,' and if we are worthy, we shall be rewarded. 'Live worthily, and a wyrm may someday enter you, granting you a portion of its immortality.' " <p></p>The child seemed to think for a long time. <p></p>Cullossax could not bother with her any longer. This was a busy time. There had been a great battle to the south, and the troops would begin to arrive any day. Once all of the reports had been made, Cullossax would be assigned to deal with those who had not distinguished themselves in battle. He would need to sharpen many of his skinning knives, so that he could remove portions of flesh from those who were not valiant. With the flesh, he would braid whips, and then lash the backs of those that he had skinned. <p></p>And then there were people like this girl-people who had somehow gained memories of another life, and who now sought to escape the horde. The tormentors had to make examples of them. <p></p>Cullossax reached under his collar, pulled out a talisman that showed his badge of office: a bloody red fist. The law required him to display it before administering torture. "What do you think your torment should be?" Cullossax asked. <p></p>Trembling almost beyond control, the girl turned her head slowly, peered up at Cullossax. "Doesn't a person have the right to protect himself from society?" <p></p>It was a question that Cullossax had never considered. It was a childish question, undeserving of consideration. "No," he answered. <p></p>Cullossax would normally have administered a beating then, perhaps broken a few bones. But he suspected that it would do no good. "If I hurt you enough, will you listen to your dogmatist? Will you internalize his teachings?" <p></p>The girl looked down, the wyrmling gesture for no. <p></p>"Then you leave me no choice," the tormentor said. <p></p>He should have strangled the child then. He should have done it in front of the others, so that they could see firsthand the penalty for disobedience. <p></p>But somehow he wanted to spare the girl that indignity. "Come with me," he said. "Your flesh will become food for your fellows." <p></p>Cullossax reached down, unlocked the manacle at the girl's foot, and pulled her free from the iron rung in the floor. The girl did not fight. <p></p>She did not pull away or strike back. She did not try to run. Instead, she gathered up her courage and followed, as Cullossax held firmly to her wrist. <p></p>I would rather die than live here, her actions seemed to say. <p></p>Cullossax was willing to oblige. <p></p>He escorted the girl from the room. Her fellows jeered as she left, heaping abuse upon her, as was proper. <p></p>And once the two were free of the classroom, the girl walked with a lighter step, as if glad that she would meet her demise. <p></p>"Where are we going?" the child asked. <p></p>Cullossax did not know the girl's name, did not want to know her name. <p></p>"To the harvesters." In wyrmling society, the weak, the sickly, and the mentally deficient were often put to use this way. Certain glands would be harvested-the adrenals, the pineal, and others-to make extracts that were used in battle. Then the bodies were harvested for meat, bone, skin, and hair. Nothing went to waste. True, Rugassa's hunters roved far and wide to supply the horde with food, but their efforts were never enough. <p></p>"Will it hurt?" <p></p>"I think," Cullossax said honestly, "that death is never kind. Still, I will show you what leniency I can." <p></p>It was not easy to make such promises. As a tormentor, Cullossax was required to dole out the punishments required by law without regard to compassion or compromise. <p></p>That seemed to answer all of her questions, and Cullossax led the girl now effortlessly down the winding corridors, through labyrinthine passages lit only by glow worms. Few of the passages were marked, but Cullossax had memorized the twists and turns long ago. Along the way, they passed through crowded corridors in the merchant district where vendors hawked trinkets carved from bones and vestments sewn from wyrmling leather. And near the arena, which was empty at the moment, they passed through lonely tunnels where the only sound was their footsteps echoing from the stone walls. Fire crickets leapt up near their feet, emitting red flashes of light, like living sparks. Once, he spotted a young boy with a bag of pale glow worms, affixing one to each wall, to keep the labyrinth lighted. <p></p>Cullossax wondered at his own reasons for wanting to show her compassion. It was high summer, and in a few weeks he would go into musth. Already he felt the edginess, the arousal, and the beginnings of the mad rage that assailed him at this time of year. The girl was desirable enough, though she was too young to go into heat. <p></p>The girl's face was blank as she walked toward her execution. Cullossax had seen that look so often before. <p></p>"What are you thinking about?" he asked, knowing that it was easier if he kept them talking. <p></p>"There are so many worlds," she said, her voice filled with wonder. "Two worlds have combined, and when they did, two of my shadow selves became one. It's like having lived two lifetimes." She fell silent for a second, then asked, "Have you ever seen the stars?" Most wyrmlings in the labyrinth would never have been topside. <p></p>"Yes," he answered, "once." <p></p>"My grandmother was the village wise woman at my home in Inkarra," the girl said. "She told me that every star is but a shadow of the One True Star, and each of them has a shadow world that spins around it, and that there are a million million shadow worlds." <p></p>"Hah," Cullossax said, intrigued. He had never heard of such a thing. The very strangeness of such a cosmology dre...</p><h2>Nocturne (Tome of Fire Trilogy)</h2><p>The third book in the popular Salamander Space Marine series<p>The third book in the Salamander series finds a dark eldar incursion that threatens the space marines homeworld</p></p><p><b>Nick Kyme</b> is a writer and editor.

Narrated by Sal Paradise, one of Kerouac's alter-egos, <i>On the Road</i> is a cross-country bohemian odyssey that not only influenced writing in the years since its 1957 publication but penetrated into the deepest levels of American thought and culture.JACK KEROUAC was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1922. His first novel, <i>The Town and the City</i>, appeared in 1950, but it was <i>On the Road</i>, first published in 1957, that established his worldwide reputation as the chronicler of the Beat Generation.

In this groundbreaking book, award-winning historian Edward Lazarus, a former clerk to Justice Harry A. Blackmun, guides the reader through the Court's inner sanctum, explaining as only an eyewitness can the collisions of law, politics, and personality as the Justices wrestle with the most fiercely disputed issues of our time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Part memoir, past history, and all spellbinding narrative, <b>Closed Chambers</b> provides an intimate portrait and devastating&nbsp;&nbsp;critique--Justice by Justice--of a court at war with itself and in neglect of its constitutional&nbsp;&nbsp;duties.<br><br>From the conservative Chief Justice Rehnquist's apparent attempt to influence the 1992 election by delaying a crucial abortion case to liberal champion Justice William Brennan's ill-conceived and ultimately self-defeating campaign to sabotage the death penalty, Lazarus's riveting account shows us a Court broken into scheming factions whose members resort to crass political calculations and transparently hypocritical arguments as they discard legal principles for bottomline results.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Justices further compound this cliquish antagonism by granting excessive power to immature, ideologically driven clerks, who then use that power to manipulate their bosses and the institution they ostensibly serve.<br><br>Edward Lazarus took part in the Court's internal battles over the death penalty, affirmative action, abortion, and other momentous issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, he weaves together past and present to show us in astonishing detail not only the tragic failings of the modern Court, but also what led to them, and why they are so devastating for the nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unprecedented in its revelations and unparalleled in the brilliance of its analysis, <b>Closed Chambers</b> is the most important book on the Supreme Court in a generation.</p><p>Edward Lazarus, a former Supreme Court clerk to Justice Harry Blackmun, spills the beans on an institution that values silence. Nobody is supposed to understand what happens behind the scenes of the high court--that's why the justices rarely speak to the media--but Lazarus tells all he knows from his time as a top aide to Blackmun in the Supreme Court's 1988 term. There's a lot of legal theory and history, but it's well presented and usually focuses on touchstone issues in U.S. politics; cases involving abortion, the death penalty, and racial preferences receive sustained treatment in these pages. There are gossipy bits, too, revealing unflattering details about several current justices. Sure to be one of the more controversial books of the year. <i>--John J. Miller</i>Early Praise for Closed Chambers <br><br>"Closed Chambers is a fascinating and troubling account of politics at the Supreme Court. Instead of stabilizing a roiling democracy by reasoned deliberation, the Supreme Court has itself become a political battlefield. At a time when Americans need an institution that stands for proportion and wisdom, the Supreme Court has abdicated and become just another venue for the noisy and fractious power struggles in modern America."<br>--Philip K. Howard, author of The Death of Common Sense<br><br>"The Supreme Court is one of America's most important institutions, and one of its least understood. In this well-researched and wonderfully written book, Edward Lazarus opens the Court to our inspection and takes us on a revealing tour of its hidden routines. Drawing on his own experiences as a law clerk, Lazarus gives us a disturbing portrait of a Court whose inner life has become politicized to a dangerous degree--dangerous because most Americans still hope that in these closed chambers their highest hopes and most divisive debates will receive a hearing in which political allegiances are suspended and reason prevails."<br>--Anthony Kronman, dean of the Yale Law School</p><h2>7 Keys to Great Paintings</h2><p>Seven Keys to Great Paintings puts the fun back into painting with lighthearted, down-to-earth instruction that also reveals the core elements of painting design. * Each of the seven chapters begins with a poem verse to help readers remember the message behind the concepts * The emphasis on watercolor will appeal to painting&#39;s largest audience, as well as general painters * Creative, game-like instruction echoes bestsellers like Watercolorist&#39;s Essential Notebook * Full-page charts and 8 well-illustrated step-by-step demos make the concepts easy to understand and apply The author&#39;s friendly, personal tone and extensive workshop experience are sure to charm and encourage painters of all levels.</p><p>Jane R.

He does give detailed accounts of the trades and strategies which were used to build winning teams in Kansas City and St. Louis.

His autobiography is notable because he is intelligent, realistic and tough-minded. He knows, for example, that it takes good players to make a good manager while a bad season will ensure the demise of the manager.

Carmen's first picture book in the US was <i>China Doll</i>, by Elza Pilgrim.PreS-Gr 2-When Brownie wakes up on the second of February, she opens her door, looks out, and scoffs, &#34;Phooey, six more weeks of winter.&#34; She does not like waiting. Before she can go back inside, a fox pounces on her, eager for breakfast. But clever Brownie finds a way to keep him busy through lunch and then dinner, spending their time looking for spring. After some skating, they&#39;ve both worked up an appetite and the fox is tired of waiting, too. By tricking Fox, Brownie&#39;s life is spared and a new friendship begins, just as the first sign of spring arrives. Segovia&#39;s acrylic and ink artwork captures the clear sky of winter and accentuates the white/gray of a heavy snowfall. Brownie&#39;s black/brown fur is set off with a bright red scarf as an equally vibrant Fox stands out against a chilly landscape. The theme of outfoxing a fox is a familiar one, but this story is particularly endearing. Children will find it delightful.-C. J.

Now the Golden State&#x2019;s premier historian, Kevin Starr, distills the entire sweep of California&#x2019;s history into one splendid volume. From the age of exploration to the age of Arnold, this is the story of a place at once quintessentially American and utterly unique.<br><br>Arguing that America&#x2019;s most populous state has always been blessed with both spectacular natural beauty and astonishing human diversity, Starr unfolds a rapid-fire epic of discovery, innovation, catastrophe, and triumph. <br><br>For generations, California&#x2019;s native peoples basked in the abundance of a climate and topography eminently suited to human habitation. By the time the Spanish arrived in the early sixteenth century, there were scores of autonomous tribes were thriving in the region. Though conquest was rapid, nearly two centuries passed before Spain exerted control over upper California through the chain of missions that stand to this day.<br><br>The discovery of gold in January 1848 changed everything. With population increasing exponentially as get-rich-quick dreamers converged from all over the world, California reinvented itself overnight. Starr deftly traces the successive waves of innovation and calamity that have broken over the state since then&#x2013;the incredible wealth of the Big Four railroad tycoons and the devastating San Francisco earthquake of 1906; the emergence of Hollywood as the world&#x2019;s entertainment capital and of Silicon Valley as the center of high-tech research and development; the heroic irrigation and transportation projects that have altered the face of the region; the role of labor, both organized and migrant, in key industries from agriculture to aerospace.<br><br>Kevin Starr has devoted his career to the history of his beloved state, but he has never lost his sense of wonder over California&#x2019;s sheer abundance and peerless variety. This one-volume distillation of a lifetime&#x2019;s work gathers together everything that is most important, most fascinating, and most revealing about our greatest state.</p><p>Legendary California historian Kevin Starr is University Professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. The recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and the gold and silver medals from the Commonwealth Club of California, he served as the state librarian of California for the decade spanning 1994 to 2004. Starr divides his time between Los Angeles and San Francisco.1<br><br> QUEEN CALAFIA&#x2019;S ISLAND<br><br> Place and First People<br><br> First described in a bestseller, California entered history as a myth. In 1510 the Spanish writer Garci Ordï¿½ï¿½ez de Montalvo issued a sequel to his 1508 prose romance Amadis de Gaula, which Montalvo had in turn based upon a late thirteenth- to early fourteenth-century Portuguese narrative derived from French sources. Published in Seville, Montalvo&#x2019;s Las Sergas de Esplandiï¿½n (The Deeds of Esplandiï¿½n) chronicled the exploits of Esplandiï¿½n, son of the hero Amadis of Gaul, at the siege of Constantinople. Among Esplandiï¿½n&#x2019;s allies at the siege were the Californians, a race of black Amazons under the command of Queen Calafia. California itself, according to Montalvo, was &#x201c;an island on the right hand of the Indies . . . very close to the side of the Terrestrial Paradise,&#x201d; abounding in gold and precious stones. The Californians rode griffins into battle and fought with golden weapons. Queen Calafia herself was &#x201c;very large in person, the most beautiful of all of them, of blooming years, and in her thoughts desirous of achieving great things, strong of limb and of great courage.&#x201d;<br><br> Equipping a fleet, Calafia had sailed to Constantinople to join the other great captains of the world in the siege against the Turks. By the end of the story, Queen Calafia and the Californians have become Christians (which involved, one surmises, giving up their promiscuous ways and the feeding of their male offspring to their griffins), and Calafia herself marries one of Esplandiï¿½n&#x2019;s trusted lieutenants, with whom she goes on to further adventures.<br><br> In 1863 the Boston antiquarian Edward Everett Hale, author of the well-known short story &#x201c;The Man Without a Country,&#x201d; sent a paper to the American Antiquarian Society in which he provided translations of key passages of Las Sergas de Esplandiï¿½n and cited the prose romance as the source of the name &#x201c;California.&#x201d; Hale&#x2019;s report was in turn reported on by The Atlantic Monthly in March 1864. Montalvo&#x2019;s two tales, Hale noted, were instant bestsellers and remained so for the rest of the sixteenth century. Not until the publication of Don Quixote de la Mancha by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra in two parts in 1605 and 1615 were Montalvo&#x2019;s romances superseded in popularity. Don Quixote, furthermore, was not the only one to take these stories as literal fact. The Spanish in general had a tendency to conflate fact with fiction when it came to these prose romances.<br><br> In 1533 a party of Spanish explorers, sailing west from Mexico across an unnamed sea at the command of Hernï¿½n Cortï¿½s, conqueror of Mexico, landed on what they believed to be an island in the recently discovered Pacific. After 1539 they began to call the place after the mythic island of California, half believing and more than fully hoping they would find there as well the gold and precious stones described in Montalvo&#x2019;s romance, and perhaps even an Amazon or two. Not until 1539&#x2013;40 did the Spanish discover their geographical mistake. California was a peninsula, not an island, and north of this peninsula&#x2014;eventually called Antigua or Old California&#x2014;was a vast northern region that the Spaniards, for one reason or another, would be unable to settle for another 230 years.<br><br> The American state of California faces the Pacific Ocean between latitude 42 degrees north (at the border of the American state of Oregon) and latitude 32 degrees north (at the border of the Mexican state of Baja California Norte). On a clear day, photographed from a satellite, California appears as a serene palette of blue, green, brown, white, and red. This apparent serenity, however, masks a titanic drama occurring beneath the surface, in the clash of the two tectonic plates upon which California rests. California itself resulted from a collision of the North American and Pacific plates. Across a hundred million years, the grinding and regrinding of these plates against each other, their sudden detachments, their thrusts above or below each other&#x2014;together with the lava flow of volcanoes, the bulldozing action of glaciers, and, later, the flow of water and the depositing of alluvial soil&#x2014;created a region almost abstract in its distinct arrangements of mountain, valley, canyon, coastline, plain, and desert. As the California-born philosopher and historian Josiah Royce observed, there is nothing subtle about the landforms and landscapes of California. Everything is scaled in bold and heroic arrangements that are easily understood.<br><br> Fronting more than half the shoreline of the western continental United States, California&#x2014;all 158,693 square miles of it&#x2014;offers clear-cut and confrontational topographies. First of all, there is the 1,264-mile Pacific shoreline itself. Thirty million years ago, tectonic action formed this shoreline by detaching a great land mass from the southern edge of the Baja California peninsula, moving it northward, and attaching it back onto the continent. At four strategic intervals&#x2014;the bay of San Diego in the south, Monterey and San Francisco bays in the midregion, and Humboldt Bay in the north&#x2014;this appended land mass opened itself to the sea and created four harbors. Formed as recently as thirty thousand years ago when mountains on the shoreline collapsed and the sea rushed in, San Francisco Bay is among the two or three finest natural harbors on the planet.<br><br> Rising from this coastline, from north to south, various mountain ranges run boldly into the Pacific. At latitude 35 degrees 30 minutes north, in the county of San Luis Obispo, these coastal mountains bifurcate into two ranges: the Transverse Ranges, veering in a southeasterly direction into southern Kern County in the interior, and the Peninsula Ranges, continuing southward down the coast. In the far north, the Klamath Mountains and the southern tip of the Cascades move in an easterly direction toward the Modoc Plateau on the northeastern corner. Running south from the Modoc Plateau is another, even more formidable mountain range, the Sierra Nevada&#x2014;John Muir&#x2019;s &#x201c;Range of Light,&#x201d; four hundred miles long, eighty miles wide&#x2014;sealing off the eastern edge of California from the Great Basin until these mighty mountains yield to the Mojave Desert in<br><br> the southeastern corner. Forty-one California mountains rise to more than ten thousand feet. The highest&#x2014;Mount Whitney&#x2014;is, at 14,496 feet, the second highest mountain in the continental United States. Mount Shasta in the north&#x2014;rising from its plain to a height of 14,162 feet, its crowning glaciers still grinding against each other&#x2014;was once an active volcano. Nearby Mount Lassen, also a volcano, was active as recently as 1921.<br><br> Thus in eons past did mountains set the stage for the essential drama of the California landscape: an interplay of heights, flatland, and coast. Coastal plains adjoin the bays of San Francisco and Monterey, and a great basin, the Los Angeles Plain, flanks the coast south of the Transverse Ranges. Four hundred and thirty miles in length, the Central Valley runs through the center of the state in two sequences, the San Joaquin Valley to the south, the Sacramento Valley to the north. Open and sweeping as well are the moonlike Modoc Plateau in the northeastern corner of the state, the high desert Great Basin on the eastern edge of the Sierra Nevada, the Mojave Desert in the southeast, and the Salton Trough thrusting itself up from Baja.<br><br> Here it is, then: a landscape of stark contrasts, vibrant and volatile with the geological forces that shaped the western edge of the continent. Numerous fault lines&#x2014;the San Andreas, the Hayward, the Garlock, the San Jacinto, the Nacimiento&#x2014;crisscross the western edge from San Francisco Bay to the Mexican border, keeping the region alive with tectonic action. Within human memory&#x2014;in 1857 at the Tejon Pass in Southern California, in 1872 in the Owens Valley, in San Francisco in 1906, in Long Beach in 1933, in the San Fernando Valley in 1971, again in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1989, and again in the San Fernando Valley in 1994&#x2014;great earthquakes shook the land, destroying lives and property. At magnitude 8.3 on the Richter scale, the San Francisco earthquake of April 18, 1906, like the Lisbon earthquake of 1775, precipitated the destruction of an entire city.<br><br> Just sixty miles from Mount Whitney, the highest point in the state, is Death Valley, the lowest point on the continent at 282 feet below sea level. Here temperatures can reach as high as 134 degrees Fahrenheit, as they did on July 10, 1913. In midsummer the Central Valley can be as hot as the Equator. Fortunately for California as a place for human settlement, however, two factors&#x2014;the California Current coming down from the northwestern Pacific, and the Pacific High, a high-pressure zone a thousand miles off the coast&#x2014;help moderate the heat of the interior. From the point of view of human preferences, coastal California&#x2014;where settlement began and maintains its greatest density&#x2014;sustains a mosaic of salubrious climates. Few climates in North America, if any, can equal that of coastal California from the point of view of human use. Like the Mediterranean, the southern littoral is warm and dry. This Mediterranean climate continues up the coast and veers inland until it meets the forested regions of the north. From Monterey Bay to the Marin headlands north of San Francisco, however, this Mediterranean climate is moistened and softened by morning sea fogs and the other mitigating influences of maritime weather. In general, coastal California rarely gets below 40 degrees...</p><h2>The Science of Success, The Secret to Getting What You Want</h2><p>A Life-Changing book that unlocks the secret to attracting health, wealth and success.</p><p></p><h2>The Boston Girl (Thorndike Press large print basic)</h2><p>From the "New York Times" bestselling author of "The Red Tent "and" Day After Night," comes an unforgettable novel about family ties and values, friendship and feminism told through the eyes of a young Jewish woman growing up in Boston in the early twentieth century. <br>Addie Baum is The Boston Girl, born in 1900 to immigrant parents who were unprepared for and suspicious of America and its effect on their three daughters. Growing up in the North End, then a teeming multicultural neighborhood, Addie's intelligence and curiosity take her to a world her parents can't imagine--a world of short skirts, movies, celebrity culture, and new opportunities for women.

First published in 1870, this treasury of 'words that have a tale to tell has established itself as one of the great reference classics-the first port of call for tens of thousands of terms, phrases and proper names, and a fund of fascinating, unusual and out-of-the-way information.</p><p>At the heart of the dictionary lie entries on the meaning and origin of a vast range of words and expressions, from everyday phrases to Latin tags. Alongside these are articles on people and events in mythology and religion, and on folk customs, superstitions and beliefs. Major events and people in history are also treated, as are movements in art and literature, famous literary characters, and key aspects of popular culture, philosophy, geography, science and magic. To complete this rich mix of information, Brewer and his subsequent editors have added an extraordinary and enticing miscellany of general knowledge-lists of patron saints, terms in heraldry, regimental nicknames, public house names, and famous last words.</p><p>For the sixteenth edition of Brewer's the entire existing text has been revised and updated and over 1000 new articles added. These include:</p><li>recent expressions (the full monty, couch</li><li>potato, bit the ground running, Montezuma's revenge)</li><li>recent events and organizations (Black Wednesday, Taliban)</li><li>famous nicknames (Fab Four)</li><li>historical and fictional characters (Attila the Hun, Anne Frank).<p>Brand-new articles on hurricane names, celebrated place-names in literature, and frequently mispronounced words continue the century-old Brewer's practice of recording unexpected and fascinating information that is not available in other general reference books.</p></li></p><p><p>Dr. Ebenezer Cobham Brewer, the son of a Norwich schoolmaster, was born in 1810. He graduated in Law from Cambridge in 1836 and two years later was ordained, before returning to teach at his father's school. There he compiled his first major work, A Guide to Science. It proved immensely popular, perhaps funding the extensive European travels he subsequently undertook.</p><p>Returning to England in 1856, he slowly put together the work that was to become Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. Much of the nucleus of the dictionary derived from correspondence with readers of his earlier works, beginning a tradition of readers' involvement with the new book that continues today. The first edition was published by Cassell in 1870 and sold over 100,000 copies. In 1894 Brewer compiled a completely revised and substantially enlarged edition.

Line drawings and small black-and-white photos replace the color illustrations found in the junior books. Definitions still include example sentences but are more complex and use a higher range of vocabulary. There are more personal names from history and fewer from popular culture than can be found in the <i>Thorndike-Barnhart Junior Dictionary</i> . There are also fewer boxed features, and those that remain ("Word Source," "Word Family") tend to be more detailed. A style manual takes into account the older, more sophisticated user. Test words are well defined; <i>set </i> and <i>take</i> include more than 15 definitions each. Another look at... Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and FableOne of the defining characteristics of an enduring reference source is the stamp of personality. <i>Famous First Facts </i> and <i>Baker's </i> Biographical Dictionary of Musicians wouldn't be the same without Joseph Nathan Kane and Nicolas Slonimsky. Another work that owes much to an attentive and even obsessive compiler is <i>Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. </i> Mid-Victorian British publisher John Cassell wanted to supply his working-class readers with material both entertaining and improving, and Dr. Ebenezer Cobham Brewer was just the person for the job. Their partnership resulted in numerous popular works, among them the famous dictionary, which was first published in 1870. The preface to the first edition described it as an "alms-basket of words," that "draws in curious or novel etymologies, pseudonyms and popular titles, local traditions and literary blunders, biographical and historical trifles too insignificant to find a place of higher pretension, but not too worthless to be worth knowing." Brewer, who was born in 1810, claimed that the dictionary evolved from his boyhood habit of note taking. Around 1841, while still a Norwich schoolmaster, he wrote a popular compendium called <i>Guide to Science, </i> which "brought me in a large number of questions on all imaginary matters." These questions and their answers formed the basis for the dictionary, so successful that the first edition was reprinted 18 times. It was designed to meet the needs of a new class of readers who did not have the advantage of a classical education. It also exemplified that impulse toward collecting and classifying that seemed to distinguish so much Victorian scholarship. The Victorian flavor was retained through many editions. In fact, as reviewers have pointed out, there was not much difference between the first edition and the fourteenth, published in 1989. Beginning with the fifteenth edition, revisions have been in the hands of Adrian Room, himself a prodigious compiler of facts, being the author of <i>Dictionary of First Names </i> (Cassell, 1995), <i>A Dictionary of Pseudonyms </i> and Their Origins (McFarland, 1997), and <i>Placenames of the World </i> (McFarland, 1997), among many other titles. In the preface to the newest edition of <i>Brewer's, </i> Room states that there are "changes on four fronts." One of these changes is the addition of 1,000 new entries. These range from older words and phrases that appear here for the first time (<i>hysteria, I Ching</i> )<i> </i> to terms of more recent vintage (<i>blockbuster, dress down </i> [as in dress-down Fridays], <i>main squeeze, millennium bug</i> ).<i> </i> There are more subentries, such as <i>down time </i> listed under <i>down. </i> Many of these new subentries actually refer the reader to main entry headings (<i>Hulk, the Incredible, </i> see under Incredible), and the much greater number of <i>see </i> references is the most obvious difference between this edition and the last. The third change is the addition of new quotations. The fourth is that some entries have been dropped. Although most of the missing are arcane terms, there is plenty left to delight the lover of the odd and obscure. In what other single volume will you find, for example, a list of the 50 Nereids listed in Edmund Spenser's <i>The </i> Faerie Queen; descriptions of famous <i>Fakes, </i> from Piltdown Man to the Hitler diaries; and almost five pages of <i>Famous last words</i> ? Not to mention patron saints and saints' symbols, the 12 oldest British public schools for girls, and British public house signs? The last two examples remind us that the book still has a very British emphasis. This emphasis helps account for some of the errors (e.g., the Chicago Bears is "a record-breaking American football team, with a home base at Wrigley Field") that continue to make their way from one edition into the next. Despite the revisions, libraries that already hold the fifteenth edition of <i>Brewer's </i> may not need to change. Updating information and rectifying omissions, two of the most compelling reasons for trading in an edition that is only a few year old for a newer model, are not major considerations in this case. Meanwhile, a full hypertext version is available on the Web, generally bundled with other titles as part of a basic reference collection (for example, at <i>Bib</i> liomania [http://www.bibliomania.com]). This is the 1894 revision, however--how many students browsing its contents will know (or care) that editions far newer and more useful for research may sit on the reference shelves nearby? That said, we feel sure that Dr. Brewer, with his fascination for stray facts, would feel right at home on the Internet, the ultimate miscellany.

The British and the colonists failed to see how swiftly they were drifting toward violence until the process had gone beyond the point of no return.</p><p>At the heart of the book lies the Boston Tea Party, an event that arose from fundamental flaws in the way the British managed their affairs. By the early 1770s, Great Britain had become a nation addicted to financial speculation, led by a political elite beset by internal rivalry and increasingly baffled by a changing world. When the East India Company came close to collapse, it patched together a rescue plan whose disastrous side effect was the destruction of the tea.</p><p><br> <i>With&nbsp;lawyers in London calling </i>the Tea Party treason, and with hawks in Parliament crying out for revenge, the British opted for punitive reprisals without foreseeing the resistance they would arouse. For their part, Americans underestimated Britain&#x2019;s determination not to give way. By the late summer of 1774, when the rebels in New England began to arm themselves, the descent into war had become irreversible.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p><p>Drawing on careful study of primary sources from Britain and the United States,&nbsp;<i>An Empire on the Edge</i>&nbsp;sheds new light on the Tea Party&#x2019;s origins and on the roles of such familiar characters as Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock, and Thomas Hutchinson. The book shows how the king&#x2019;s chief minister, Lord North, found himself driven down the road to bloodshed. At his side was Lord Dartmouth, the colonial secretary, an evangelical Christian renowned for his benevolence. In a story filled with painful ironies, perhaps the saddest was this: that Dartmouth, a man who loved peace, had to write the dispatch that sent the British army out to fight.</p></p><p><p>Nick Bunker is the author of <i>Making Haste from Babylon</i>, a history of the <i>Mayflower</i> Pilgrims, described by <i>The Washington Post</i> as &#x201c;a remarkable success.&#x201d; Educated at King&#x2019;s College, Cambridge, and Columbia University, he was a journalist for the <i>Liverpool Echo</i> and the <i>Financial Times</i>, and then an investment banker, chiefly with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.

Reaching the top he would look down across a wide and muddy tract of land filled with corn and ripe tobacco. Beyond the fields and just before the river, his gaze would fall upon a line of battlements built with limestone quarried from the ridge. They belonged to a fort with platforms for cannon at each corner and a British flag flying above it. As the traveler crossed the plain, more details would emerge from out of the haze. He would see a moat, a sloping earthwork, and a row of huts near the fort, with the smoke from kitchen fires hanging in the sunshine.<br><br>From a distance the fort&#x2019;s defenses seemed solid enough, but the traveler would soon identify odd traces of neglect. Nobody had cut the tall grass by the gate. Heaps of rubble lay beside the track, all that was left of a village or a few abandoned farms. Some broken fences remained, but the cattle they corralled had vanished long ago; the corn was running wild; and many years had passed since a field hand took a harvest of tobacco leaf. In the dusk, the traveler might exchange a greeting with the redcoats who stood sentry in this corner of the wilderness. They would offer him some rum and show him around the back of the fort, where he would find more evidence of decay. Close to the walls, the riverbank dipped away steeply in a cliff of yellow sand. From time to time parts of it crumbled and fell, to be carried off by the Mississippi in the night.<br><br>Far away at army headquarters in New York, the base by the river was officially listed as Fort Cavendish, after an English general of noble blood who never found time to cross the Atlantic. On the frontier, the redcoats chose to keep the name the French had given to the place. To a Frenchman, the post was known as Fort de Chartres, mispronounced by the British as Fort Charters. By the early 1770s, it was slipping into ruin like the rest of the imperial system to which the base belonged. From the French, the British had inherited a post constructed on moist, low-ï¿½lying ground, close to a bayou and next to a swamp, in a site so exposed that the walls needed constant repair until at last they collapsed entirely. Handsome to look at but far too costly to maintain, the fort was built on weak foundations, the British had acquired it without a cogent plan for its future, and in time it was bound to collapse. In other words, the post symbolized Great Britain&#x2019;s plight in North America as a whole, a continent she did not comprehend and could not hope to rule.<br><br>In theory, Fort Charters controlled a long line of communication from Lake Michigan down to the Gulf of Mexico. In practice, the authority of King George III stretched no further than a field gun could fire six pounds of iron from the ramparts. Much the same was true in the rest of his American dominions, where his position would soon become almost as untenable as the fort.<br><br>In the story of what happened to the British in Illinois, we can find a parable about the vanity of empire. It is a tale of error and misunderstanding, of ideas only half ï¿½thought out, of neglect and delay and occasional corruption. The occupation of Fort Charters would end in failure after a pitiful waste of lives and money: a foretaste of what was to come when, soon afterward, the British lost not only the Mississippi valley but also the loyalty of their old colonies along the eastern seaboard, as the American Revolution started to unfold.<br><br>The British involvement in the far west had begun in 1763, by the stroke of a pen at a conference in Paris. A treaty negotiated at the Louvre put an end to the Seven Years&#x2019; War, a conflict fought out on three continents between France, Spain, and Austria on the one hand, and Great Britain and its Prussian allies on the other. In exchange for peace the French king Louis XV ceded away a string of islands in the Caribbean and all his possessions on the frontier from Quebec to Alabama. Suddenly the British acquired a vast new domain beyond the Appalachians: a territory so immense that two more years passed before they could hoist their colors above every post the French had surrendered.<br><br>Caring nothing for the politics of Europe, soon after the signing of the peace of Paris the native tribes rose in rebellion, forcing the British to fight the bloody campaign known as Pontiac&#x2019;s War. Even when it ended, not in outright victory but in a fragile truce, the redcoats could not occupy Fort Charters immediately. First they had to send envoys with liquor and ammunition to win over the local chieftains who had never joined the uprising or been parties to the armistice. And when at last a deal was struck, the British still had to find a way to reach the Mississippi, a journey the army had never made before.<br><br>To undertake the mission, they chose the Black Watch, a Scottish regiment used to empty stomachs and hard fighting in the rain. From their nearest camp on the Ohio River it took eight weeks by boat for the Highland soldiers to reach Fort Charters to collect the keys from the ragged platoon of Frenchmen who formed its garrison. That was in the autumn of 1765. At first, the redcoats were enthusiastic, finding the geography superb. Since every British officer either came from the landowning classes or aspired to join them, they appraised the landscape as though it were a vast estate at home, with ample capabilities for pleasure and for profit. It was, said one lieutenant, &#x201c;the finest Country in the known World,&#x201d; with its rich soil, its bears and buffalo, and a multitude of deer to stalk. But while the British admired the wildlife, they could not abide the people they met. Soon their letters east began to carry warnings that the fort could not be held.<br><br>&#x201c;Your excellency knows the French,&#x201d; the base commander wrote. &#x201c;You will sooner imagine than I can describe the trouble they give me.&#x201d; In the Illinois country, King Louis had left behind hundreds of settlers, men and women from Quebec who inhabited their own little world by the river, growing wheat for the West Indies and drinking wine made from wild grapes. Unwilling to remain among the redcoats, most of the French soon disappeared across the water into Spanish-ï¿½held territory, taking with them their cows and their Jesuit priest. Those who remained were defiant, demanding their own laws, free exercise of their religion, and their own elected assembly.<br><br>If the French were difficult, the native people were impossible. In the spring they would gather at Fort Charters, hoping for gifts of food to tide them over until their own harvest of corn. This was part of a system the French had created to keep the peace without using force, but the British found it hard to feed even themselves. Unable to keep the old French bargain with the Indians, the Scotsmen were encircled by hostile clans more ruthless than any cattle raider from Loch Ness. One year, a war party silently entered the cottages outside the ramparts and slaughtered a British soldier and his wife in bed. A month later they took more scalps from a community of peaceful Indians who lived nearby. Too few to fight back, the redcoats could do nothing but send another weary letter to headquarters.<br><br>Of all their adversaries, the most destructive was the Mississippi. When the snows melted far to the north, the river would begin to rise, sending a tide of brown water surging around a bend until the bastions at each angle of the fort began to shift and crack. After finishing their tour of duty the Black Watch had gone, to be replaced by Irishmen who tried to strengthen the walls by ramming stones into the bank in winter, only to see the spring floods wash them away. And when at last in late summer the river fell, it left stagnant pools filled with mosquitoes, from which disease crept up to infect the barracks and the married quarters. In a single month in 1768, fever killed sixty men, women, and children, leaving only a few dozen soldiers fit to hold a musket. &#x201c;We Carried out in a Cart four and five a day,&#x201d; wrote an ensign. &#x201c;The poor little Infant Orphans following.&#x201d;<br><br>As each season went by, new tales of woe flowed back to New York to reach the desk of Thomas Gage, the British commander in chief. The dispatches made sorry reading for the officer who had drawn up the original scheme for occupying the frontier. After the truce with Pontiac, General Gage had planned to secure the wilderness with a series of posts like Fort Charters, slung like an iron chain around the pays d&#x2019;en haut, the high country, between the Great Lakes and Tennessee. Further east, the British hoped to keep the peace with their old treaties with the Iroquois, which left the tribes free to enjoy their ancient hunting grounds safe from interference by settlers from the colonies along the coast. Between them, the forts and the treaties would give the British control of the fur trade, the only kind of wealth Gage believed the wilderness could yield.<br><br>From Manhattan the strategy might have seemed plausible, but it rested on foundations as flimsy as those of the fort. For their supplies and trading goods, the British in Illinois had to rely on shipments from Philadelphia, a thousand miles away, coming by a route so costly that they could rarely turn a profit from dealing in skins. How much easier it would have been if the knives and blankets could have sailed upriver from New Orleans; but when the British signed the Paris treaty, they misread the map, giving the king of Spain all the open channels from the Mississippi to the gulf. And meanwhile, closer to home the old British deal with the Iroquois amounted to another bargain they could not guarantee. It would only survive while Gage maintained the flow of gifts and gunpowder and kept his promise that Pennsylvania and Virginia would leave the tribes unmolested. With each year that passed, these conditions grew harder to fulfill.<br><br>Gage could not even trust his own subordinates. Rumors began to circulate about bullying, fraud, and embezzlement in the Illinois country: this was a way of life in the British army, where for years the officers went on claiming pay for men who were long since dead, but on the frontier the colonels and the majors plumbed new depths of scandal. Embarrassing, expensive, and impossible to manage, the western wilderness swiftly became a luxury that General Gage could not afford.<br><br>Across his whole command from Nova Scotia to the Bahamas, he could deploy only fifteen battalions of foot. He had no cavalry at all. Including their engineers and their artillery, the redcoats in North America amounted to fewer than six thousand men, half as many as the British kept in Ireland. With such a small army and a budget that never seemed to be enough, the general could not police a continent. Although he was rarely a bold commander in the field, Thomas Gage understood the logistics of his army, and he kept careful accounts of every shilling he spent. Soon he bowed to the inevitable and began to plan the evacuation of the frontier barely two years after his soldiers had arrived in Illinois.<br><br>By the spring of 1767, the general&#x2019;s letters home about the frontier had become essays in despair. Repeatedly, he made the case for abandoning it entirely, not only the post at Fort Charters, but also Pittsburgh and Detroit and all the others in the wilderness. Time and again, he met with little more than procrastination. As early as 1768, Gage&#x2019;s new strategy of withdrawal from the wilderness received the backing of the relevant minister, Lord Hillsborough, the colonial secretary, a pessimist about the prospects for America, but Hillsborough could not make the rest of the British cabinet see sense. Compared with the affairs of Europe or the endless maneuvers for power at home, the Mississippi valley seemed too trivial to bother with. Decisions about it were continually deferred.<br><br>Even the experts in London disagreed about the role the wilderness should play in the empire&#x2019;s destiny. None at all, said some, because, according to a royal proclamation, dating from the same year as the peace of Paris, the American colonists were supposed to remain firmly behind the Appalachians, hugging the seaboard as docile subjects of the Crown. Allow them to cross the mountains, and they would provoke another Indian war like Pontiac&#x2019;s. Worse still, the settlers might shake off their loyalty to the king and begin to build workshops and factories on the frontier to compete with those of England. But while the official doctrine reserved the interior for the tribes, others took a different view, lobbying hard for expansion in the wilderness as a way to make money for the king or for themselves. Adrift between competing opinions, the British preferred to do nothing about the region, as though somehow or other the problems it posed would resolve themselves.<br><br>And then at last, in the autumn of 1771, a moment came when a decision about the Illinois country could no longer be postponed. Sent out by General Gage, an officer of engineers arrived at Fort Charters, surveyed the post, and then under cover of night slipped out by canoe to avoid an Indian ambush. After many detours he made his way back to New York with the damning evidence that Gage required. By now, only a few yards of solid ground remained between the river and the walls. Another spring flood would cause the fort to collapse.<br><br>Keen to concentrate his army on the eastern seaboard to deter the colonists from disobedience to the Crown, Gage relayed the report to London, where, in November, it reached Lord Hillsborough, who immediately took it to the cabinet and the king. Reluctantly, they gave the order to evacuate. The following spring, as the walls of Fort Charters began to slide into the Mississippi, the redcoats left the post for good. On the rim of the empire the army gave up one fort after another, but the orderly withdrawal that General Gage intended soon became a rout, as even bases that he meant to keep fell apart for lack of money to maintain them.</p><h2>Hands on the Freedom Plow: Personal Accounts by Women in SNCC</h2><p>In <i>Hands on the Freedom Plow,</i> fifty-two women--northern and southern, young and old, urban and rural, black, white, and Latina--share their courageous personal stories of working for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) on the front lines of the Civil Rights Movement.&nbsp;The testimonies gathered here present a sweeping personal history of SNCC: early sit-ins, voter registration campaigns, and freedom rides; the 1963 March on Washington, the Mississippi Freedom Summer, and the movements in Alabama and Maryland; and Black Power and antiwar activism. Since the women spent time in the Deep South, many also describe risking their lives through beatings and arrests and witnessing unspeakable violence. These intense stories depict women, many very young, dealing with extreme fear and finding the remarkable strength to survive.&nbsp;The women in SNCC acquired new skills, experienced personal growth, sustained one another, and even had fun in the midst of serious struggle. Readers are privy to their analyses of the Movement, its tactics, strategies, and underlying philosophies. The contributors revisit central debates of the struggle including the role of nonviolence and self-defense, the role of white people in a black-led movement, and the role of women within the Movement and the society at large.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Each story reveals how the struggle for social change was formed, supported, and maintained by the women who kept their "hands on the freedom plow." As the editors write in the introduction, "Though the voices are different, they all tell the same story--of women bursting out of constraints, leaving school, leaving their hometowns, meeting new people, talking into the night, laughing, going to jail, being afraid, teaching in Freedom Schools, working in the field, dancing at the Elks Hall, working the WATS line to relay horror story after horror story, telling the press, telling the story, telling the word.

As trappers in a hostile, trackless land, their exploits opened the gates of the mountains for the wagon trains of pioneers who followed them. In <i>Give Your Heart to the Hawks</i>, Win Blevins presents a poetic tribute to these dauntless "first Westerners" and their incredible adventures. Here, among many, are the stories of:* John Colter, who, in 1808, naked and without weapons or food, escaped captivity by the Blackfeet and ran and walked 250 miles to Fort Lisa at the mouth of the Yellowstone River;* Hugh Glass, who was mauled by a grizzly in 1823, left for dead by his trapper companions, and <i>crawled</i> 300 miles to Fort Kiowa on the Missouri; * Kit Carson, who ran away from home at age 17, became a legendary mountain man in his 20s and served as scout and guide for John C. Fremont's westward explorations of the 1840s;* Jedediah Smith, a tall, gaunt, Bible-reading New Yorker whose trapping expeditions ranged from the Rockies to California and who was killed by Comanches on the Cimarron in 1831.</p><p><p>&#x201c;I came naturally by my yen to wander far places, physical, imaginary, and spiritual...&#x201d;-<i>Win Blevins</i> <b>Win Blevins</b>, of Cherokee, Irish and Welsh descent, is from a family that was on the move, always west. Win's childhood was spent roaming, his dad a railroad man. Win went to school in St. Louis, and the family spent summers in little towns along the tracks of the railroads. He listened to the whistles blow at night and wanted to go wherever the trains went.<br>Seldom has a young man been in more of a hurry. Using scholarships, Win ran through a succession of colleges, receiving his master's degree, with honors, in English from Columbia University. He taught at Purdue University and Franklin College, then received a fellowship to attend USC. Win became a newspaperman - a music, theater, and film critic for both major Los Angeles papers. In 1972 he took the big leap-he quit his job to write out his passions-exploring and learning wild places-full time. His greatest passion of all has been to set the stories of these places, their people and animals, colors and smells, into books.<br>Win climbed mountains for ten years. A fluke blizzard caught him on a mountaintop and froze his feet, an end to climbing mountains, but not to exploring them. He's rafted rivers in the west, particularly the Snake and the San Juan, and was briefly a river guide. His love of the great Yellowstone River gave him a fine appreciation for the people who first loved these wild places. Along the way, Win lost the use of his legs and learned to sail, deciding a boat was a good place for a man without legs. He regained the use of his legs, and maintains his love of the open seas. <br>His first book, <i>Give Your Heart to the Hawks</i>, is still in print after thirty years. Other works include <i>Stone Song</i>, a novel about Crazy Horse, for which he won the 1996 Mountains and Plains Booksellers Award and the 1996 Spur Award. He's written 15 books, including a Dictionary of the American West, numerous screenplays and magazine articles. <br>He lives quietly in the canyon country of Utah. His passions grow with time-his wife Meredith, the center of his life, their five kids and grandkids. Classical music, baseball, roaming red rock mesas in the astonishing countryside, playing music... He considers himself blessed to be one of the people creating new stories about the west, and is proud to call himself a member of the world's oldest profession-storyteller.</p><p>"It was an epic time, which lasted hardly more than a third of a century before civilization swarmed west on trails the mountain men had blazed. Now Blevins sees they are paid the awed honor that is due them, in a book which has the drama and suspense of a novel." &#x2015;<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>"Win Blevins has long since won his place among the West's very best." &#x2015;Tony Hillerman</p><p>"For the lover of the early West, it is good entertainment...with lots of color, suspense and excitement." <i>&#x2015;The Denver Post</i></p></p><h2>In a Tight Spot: Low Beginning (Novel Scenes)</h2><p>Text for students of English as a second language.</p><p></p><h2>The Spiritual Warrior&#39;s Prayer Guide</h2><p>God&#39;s Word is the strongest weapon in your spiritual artillery.

William and Charles Mayo more than 100 years ago. Mayo provides family-oriented health care to pregnant women and their babies for both normal and high-risk pregnancies and births.

A live-in pediatrician would be nice; a 750-page comprehensive reference guide is the next best solution. It won&#39;t eliminate anxiety, but it&#39;s a reassuring presence, and a soothing source of answers and explanations.<p>Mayo Clinic took root in farm fields near Rochester, Minn., in the late 1800s. It grew from the medical practice of a country doctor, William Worrall Mayo, and the partnership of his two sons, William J. and Charles H. Mayo &#x2013; affectionately known as Dr. Will and Dr. Charlie.</p><p>The brothers' innovative ideas and tireless work in learning and creating new surgical techniques attracted international attention. Physicians from around the world came to watch the Mayo brothers perform surgery.</p><p>The Mayo brothers invited other doctors to join them, forming teams of medical experts.

But faced with a tormenting life-and-death decision, Abby helps direct a crash victim's harvested heart to a dying teenager -- instead of the wealthy older woman who was supposed to receive it. The repercussions leave Abby shaken and plagued with self-doubt. <br> Suddenly, a new heart appears, and the woman's transplant is completed. Then Abby makes a terrible discovery. The donor records have been falsified -- the new heart has not come through the proper channels. Defying the hospital's demands for silence, she begins her own investigation that reveals a murderous, unthinkable conspiracy. Every move Abby makes spawns a vicious backlash...and on a ship anchored in the waters of Boston harbor, the grisly truth lies waiting.</p><p>When Robin Cook wrote Coma in 1977, the idea of hospital patients being incubated for their vital organs sounded like science fiction. Twenty years later, this gripping thriller about a thriving international black market in human hearts, livers and kidneys could come from tomorrow's "Nightline." Author Gerritsen was an internist before she switched her energies to writing, and her experience shows in every scene. When young surgical resident Dr. Abby DiMatteo assists at her first "harvest" (the removal of living organs from a patient declared legally brain dead) at Boston's posh Bayside Hospital, "she felt vaguely nauseated by the whine of the blade, the smell of bone dust," neither of which seem to bother the veterans. It's obviously a personal memory being mined for good fictional purposes. (Gerritsen wrote paperback romance novels before <b>Harvest</b>: Check out her Keeper of the Bride and Thief of Hearts.)In a novel of harrowing suspense and brilliantly crafted plot twists, author Tess Gerritsen draws on her years of experience as a doctor to deliver an explosive thriller that makes her an indisputable star. HARVEST vividly portrays a young woman doctor challenging a world where medical miracles and greed fuel a lethal conspiracy-and the bright lights of the O.R. conceal the ultimate corruption of genius. Unerringly authentic, with scalpel-sharp characterizations that rival Patricia Cornwell's HARVEST is an astounding debut.... <p> <b>HARVEST <br> TESS GERRITSEN</b> </p><p> For Dr. Abby DiMatteo, the road to Boston's Bayside Hospital began with a tragic accident-and the desperate, awful weeks that followed as she watched her little brother, Pete, lose his battle to live. Despite her small-town roots and lack of money, Abby pushed through college and medical school, each achievement strengthening her ambition to reach higher. Now, immersed in the grinding fatigue of her second year as a surgical resident, she's elated when the hospital's elite cardiac transplant team taps her as a potential recruit. </p><p> But Abby soon makes an anguished, crucial decision that jeopardizes her entire career. A car crash victim's healthy heart is ready to be harvested; it is immediately cross-matched to a wealthy private patient, forty-six-year-old Nina Voss. Abby and chief resident Vivian Chao hatch a bold plan to make sure that the transplant goes instead to a dying seventeen-year-old boy who is also a perfect match. </p><p> The repercussions are powerful and swift; Dr. Chao resigns, bowing under the combined fury of the hospital's top staff and Nina Voss's outraged husband. Abby is shaken but unrepentant-until she meets the frail, tormented Nina. Then a new heart for Nina Voss suddenly appears, her transplant is completed, and Abby makes a terrible discovery. The donor records have been falsified-Nina's heart has not come through the proper channels. </p><p> Defying Bayside Hospital's demands for silence, Abby, with Vivian Chao's help, plunges into an investigation that reveals an intricate, and murderous, chain of deceptions. Every move Abby makes spawns a vicious backlash... and, in a ship anchored in the stagnant waters of Boston Harbor, a final, grisly discovery lies waiting.... </p><p> As compelling as the best Michael Crichton of Michael Palmer, more provocative than tomorrow's headlines, HARVEST is a mesmerizing read-and Tess Gerritsen proves herself to be a new master of first-class suspense fiction.</p></p><h2>The Patriarch: The Rise and Fall of the Bingham Dynasty</h2><p>An account of the rise and collapse of the Bingham family of Kentucky chronicles three generations of a newspaper dynasty and the battles that destroyed the family</p><p>Susan E.

Reprint.</p><p>Founded in 1991 as a nonprofit forensic investigative team, NecroSearch International specializes in homicide cases shelved because of "corpus indelecti" that is, a body cannot be produced as evidence that a murder has taken place. Coming from a wide range of backgrounds geophysicists to "cadaver dog" specialists to chemists and rank-and-file cops the members of NecroSearch combine their skills to produce the most proficient (and most exciting) detective work since Sherlock Holmes. They take the coldest cases and comb for hidden graves on rural hillsides, in suburban backyards and at the bottom of mud-choked riverbeds, searching for remains that have been buried anywhere from two to 20 years. (Or 70, as in the notorious Romanov family case.) Having sharpened his true crime teeth on Monster, Jackson competes here with two other books on forensic science to appear this season: Michael Baden and Marion Roach's Dead Reckoning and Corpse by Jessica Snyder Sachs. But while those books concentrate on the establishment of forensic methods as formidable weapons in the fight for criminal justice, this book combines the burden of scientific proof with rousing tales of police work out in the field or the quarry, the Rocky Mountains or someone's backyard. The book covers the group's quirky beginnings and digs into its most important cases suspensefully; Jackson's sharp eye misses nothing in the painstakingly rendered details. A must-have for true crime fans, it should also be of great interest to anyone fascinated with the practical applications of science. 32 pages of photos not seen by PW. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><i>"The book covers the group's quirky beginnings and digs into its most important cases suspensefully; Jackson's sharp eye misses nothing in the painstakingly rendered details.

A Survival Guide and Fiasco in Four Parts</h2><p>The illustrator of the popular Pressed Fairy albums and the author of The Runes of Elfland share their collaborative &#34;investigations&#34; into the maleficent world of goblins, in a nonsensical volume that profiles common goblin traits and offers advice on what to do if one&#39;s home becomes goblin infested. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>Brian Froud is an award-winning illustrator, author, and faery authority. His books include the international best-sellers <i>Faeries</i>, <i>Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Book</i>, <i>Lady Cottington's Fairy Album</i>, and <i>The Faeries' Oracle</i>. He also served as the conceptual designer on Jim Henson's films <i>The Dark Crystal</i> and <i>Labyrinth</i>. Froud lives in Devon, England. Ari Berk is a folklorist, poet, and scholar of literature, ethnography, iconography, and comparative myth. He is also the author of popular titles for children, as well as <i>The Runes of Elfland</i> with Brian Froud. Berk is associate professor of English at Central Michigan University.The conceit of renowned fantasy illustrator Froud&#x2019;s latest book (after The Runes of Elfland; Lady Cottington&#x2019;s Faerie Album; Faeries; etc.) is a clever one. The title page announces that, after working on the text and illustrations, Froud and his colleague Berk disappeared, leaving behind the dangerous fruits of their research into the goblin world. In a letter marked with suspicious red scribbles, they beg the publisher not to print their work, but the publisher decides to go ahead and release the book "as is"&#x2014;which means that Froud&#x2019;s drawings and Berk&#x2019;s notes appear mussed up by dirty goblin fingerprints and scrawled with indignant goblin commentary. For example, next to Froud&#x2019;s drawing of a very grubby goblin named the Royal Lady Empyreuma Frouzy, the authors&#x2019; goblin informer writes: "nonsense this is sardine sallie she olde girrlfriend." The whole book is pretty delightful, even for&#x2014;or perhaps especially for&#x2014;those who couldn&#x2019;t stand Froud&#x2019;s pretty, ethereal faeries.<br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Initially employed as a draftswoman in the studio of R.M. Schindler, McCoy became intimately involved in the preservationist politics of Los Angeles, contributing significant coverage of controversial slum clearances and spending nearly a decade campaigning to save Dodge House in West Hollywood from demolition. By 1960, McCoy had published <i>Five California Architects</i>, her seminal study of the work of Irving Gill, Charles and Henry Greene, Bernard Maybeck and Rudolf Schindler. Through this pioneering volume and subsequent books, essays and lectures, McCoy established the terms by which we understand the history of California modernism today. <i>Sympathetic Seeing: Esther McCoy and the Heart of American Modernist Architecture and Design</i> is the first major catalogue to survey this distinguished figure&#x2019;s life and work.

Using the company's archives and other original records enables Klein to tell the story from the inside. His central thesis is that lack of strong leadership and internal bickering weakened the railroad's financial, organizational, and political capabilities to operate profitably, ultimately forcing Union Pacific into receivership in 1893. Railroad buffs will, no doubt, savor every morsel, but general readers will probably be surfeited long before the end of this very rich feast of information and commentary.

Berry Brazelton, M.D., professor emeritus, Harvard Medical School). ---&#34;Anyone who deals with infants and young children will want to read &#39;The Wonder Weeks.&#39; This book will open parents&#39; eyes to aspects of their children&#39;s growth, development, changing behavior, and emotional responsiveness that they might otherwise not notice or find puzzling and distressing.&#34; (Catherine Snow, Ph.D., Shattuck Professor of Education, Harvard Graduate School of Education). ---&#34;van de Rijt and Plooij&#39;s work on infant development has enormous value for clinical use and scientific application. Not only have they explained the periods of puzzling, difficult behavior in infancy which so worry parents, they have also shown how these behaviors mark developmental leaps and have described the stages in the infant&#39;s understanding. Together, this gives parents and professionals soundly based insight into babies&#39; developing minds. What&#39;s more, van de Rijt and Plooij have described the play and communication that work best with babies at different ages and thus helped parents understand and connect sensitively with their babies. This parent-child connection is the major prerequisite for the development of secure, well-adjusted children. &#39;The Wonder Weeks&#39; is essential reading for everyone who works with infants: pediatricians, social workers, psychologists, and, of course, parents.&#34; (John Richer, Ph.D., Dip. Clin. Psychol., consultant clinical psychologist and Head of Pediatric Psychology, Department of Pediatrics, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, England). ---&#34;van de Rijt and Plooij will help you see the world the way an infant sees it. As the child grows, displays of emotion (such as crying) tell us the child is summoning reserves of energy and is calling out for help in finding new ways to perceive the changing world. Because van de Rijt and Plooij have discovered predictable stages in the widening of the infant&#39;s perceptions and skills, they can enable you, with their superb examples, to recognize the onset of these stressful episodes and to join your child in coping with them. So rich, indeed, are the implications of finding new perceptions and new skills in the midst of stress that whether or not you are a parent, it can never be too early or too late to profit from this book.&#34; (Philip J. Runkel, Ph.D., professor emeritus of psychology and education, University of Oregon). ---&#34;&#39;Terrible Twos&#39; a Misnomer, According to Research; Extended Edition of International Bestseller Released, Helps Parents Weather Emotional Storms. Research shows that the so-called &#39;terrible twos&#39; don&#39;t need to exist when it comes to child development. In fact, the behavior often associated with this stage - tantrums, moodiness, nagging and an affinity for the word &#39;no&#39; - begins shortly after the first birthday. For parents, it is important to jump into action at this point so they can prevent the &#39;two&#39;s&#39; from becoming terrible and turn them into something tremendous. A child doesn&#39;t need to act so &#39;terrible,&#39; as long as you know what to do and, more important, why he is acting this way. By understanding these leaps you can make the transition into toddlerhood, and the subsequent stages including the &#39;terrible two&#39;s,&#39; into the &#39;tremendous two&#39;s&#39; and beyond. &#39;Tremendous,&#39; says Dr. Plooij, &#39;because it is with these leaps that a huge part of socialization is set for life. And tremendous: because good values and norms start now. If you invest in your toddler in this time, it will pay off for lifetime and especially in puberty.&#34; (From the SFGate, home of the San Francisco Chronicle). &#34;For those of us who love &#39;The Wonder Weeks&#39; but wish it wasn&#39;t just about babies, your wish is granted. They&#39;ve just released a new, expanded edition that goes up to 20 months and has more ideas about things you can do during the wonder week leaps to make the leaps more entertaining for you and, presumably, your baby. US$25 at Amazon, which makes it the perfect baby shower or new-parent or gift-giving-holiday-at-the-end-of-the-calendar-year gift.&#34; (AskMoxie.org). ---&#34;Great News! &#39;The Wonder Weeks&#39; have come out with their new, expanded edition up to 20 months old. I love this book, and highly recommend it for some fascinating reading on what is really happening in your little one&#39;s development. (Best Milk Bistro, via Facebook). ---&#34; &#39;The Wonder Weeks&#39; - a look at cognitive growth in the first year - why might the baby be fussy, and what can parents do.&#34; (via Carolyn Hax, The Washington Post Writers&#39; Group, Facebook followers). ---&#34; &#39;The Wonder Weeks&#39; is a great book for new parents! It takes you step by step through the first two years of life and helps explain out those mysterious times in your child&#39;s life where you think your fabulously well behaved child has suddenly become possessed... I can&#39;t wait to get my hands on an updated copy of this book, because I think the insights will be invaluable in terms of being prepared and navigating the independence stage in a positive way!&#34; (Heather, ActingBalanced.com). ---&#34;We&#39;ve found &#39;THE&#39; must have gift for all parent&#39;s to be! &#39;The Wonder Weeks - How to stimulate your baby&#39;s mental development and help them turn their 10 predictable, great, fussy phases into magical leaps forward&#39;!&#34; (WHO Adelaide Chummy Mummy&#39; and &#39;Tot Shop&#39;). ---&#34;Everything I know about when and what the actual developmental spurts are I learned from the book &#39;The Wonder Weeks.&#39; One of the things I love about this book is that they don&#39;t tell you what to do, aside from suggesting games to play. They just tell you what&#39;s going on. I have a definite bias against books that tell you how to raise your kids, and I love that this book is just a roadmap of what&#39;s going on when.&#34; (AskMoxie.org). ---&#34;If you want to be really prepared for the &#39;regressions,&#39; I&#39;d say borrow or buy &#39;the Wonder Weeks&#39; book, read it, and pay attention to the signals your baby is giving you. Once you know what&#39;s going on, it becomes fasciating and annoying instead of worrisome and torturous.&#34; (AskMoxie.org). ---&#34;You all know of my love for the book &#39;The Wonder Weeks.&#39; I love it because it explains what developmental leaps happen when with your child, up through the first 15 months or so, so you know why your happy or sleeping baby is suddenly wigging out and/or not sleeping. By doing that, it revealed exactly why there&#39;s a hideous 4-month sleep regression as well as an equally-if-not-more-hideous 8-9-month sleep regression. It&#39;s a book that tells you what&#39;s going on, not what you&#39;re supposed to do. I can&#39;t count the number of times people have said to me, &#39;It let me have patience with my baby and realize I wasn&#39;t doing anything wrong.&#39; Score.&#34; (AskMoxie.org). ---&#34;So last week I was on Twitter and discovered that &#39;The Wonder Weeks&#39; has a Twitter feed (http://twitter.com/thewonderweeks) and...an iPhone app. Which I think is just brilliant. Also, the iPhone app is only US$2 (yes, that&#39;s two dollars). Even more brilliant.&#34; (AskMoxie.org). ---&#34;Anyone who knows me, knows how much I love this book, &#39;The Wonder Weeks,&#39; to describe the age-linked changes (leaps) in development in a baby&#39;s first 14 mos. If you don&#39;t have this book, and you have a baby, GET IT! Fascinating read. And now they are here on FB and Twitter @thewonderweeks, they also have an iPhone App.&#34; (Stacy Rodes Meyers, Founder, BestMilkBistro.com). ---&#34;Ask Moxie is a HUGE proponent of your book, that&#39;s how most people probably learned of it. At least I did, almost 3 years ago and waited for it to be back in print. I LOVE it!&#34; (Stacy Rodes Meyers, Founder, BestMilkBistro.com). ---&#34;I highly recommend the book, &#39;The Wonder Weeks&#39; as they all really do go through extra clingy phases when going through developmental changes. If I recall, around now give or take a couple weeks they go through a stage of separation anxiety as developmentally they&#39;ve realized that you&#39;re capable of moving away from them and that the distance between you is out of their control. I&#39;d love to go into it more but I&#39;m sneaking in some online time while feeding the monkey in between packing for holidays!&#34; (Petra, Boston, via BundleJungle.com). ---&#34;I&#39;ve got &#39;The Wonder Weeks&#39; and refer to it constantly. It&#39;s not just the odd day though, or even the odd group of days, its been every single day since he was born, he will go to other people once he knows them, but I still have to be in eye sight, and the sleeping thing is crazy, I can&#39;t even nurse him off to sleep and then sneak out off the room, its like he feels the pressure change on the mattress and instantly wakes.&#34; (Moderator, BundleJungle.com). ---&#34;Thanks so much! I LOVE the book!!!&#34; (AnnMarie, Kentucky). ---&#34;I LOVE your book and cannot stop suggesting it to friends!&#34; (Janelle, California). ---&#34;I have been using the info in this book since I first got some notes on the Dutch version (in English) WAAAAY back more than a decade ago. I still give this book as an essential book for new parents. It makes so much just plain sense, when otherwise, it seems random!&#34; (Heather, Delaware). ---&#34;This book is &#39;exactly&#39; what every new parent wants: a guide that tells exactly why your baby is fine one week and freaking out the next. We all know about the physical growth spurts at 3 and 6 weeks and then 3 and 6 months, but there isn&#39;t anything else that tells you when developmental spurts are happening. Until now. As soon as I got this book, I went back and looked in my journal from when my son was a baby, and all his fussy weeks matched up with the ones in the book! If I&#39;d had this book at the time, it would have been so much easier just to roll with it and not wonder what was &#39;wrong&#39;.&#34; (IME). ---&#34;The best thing about this book is that it doesn&#39;t tell you how to be a perfect parent, or give you some focacta plan you have to follow exactly to make your baby turn out the right way. Instead it just tells you why your baby is doing what s/he is doing, so you can have patience and not worry that there&#39;s something wrong with either you as a parent or your child.&#34; ---&#34;I just ordered two more to give to new parents I know. This is my one constant shower gift. I can&#39;t believe this book hasn&#39;t gotten more press than it has, because it would really be a lifesaver for any parent with a baby under the age of 1.&#34; (AskMoxie.org). ---&#34;I recently purchased &#39;The Wonder Weeks&#39; to try to help understand why my 4 month old daughter was going through a horrible sleep regression. I found the book to be reassuring - knowing that some things are phases rather than the &#39;new her&#39;. As expected, she went back to being more predictable after the new developments. It&#39;s helpful to know when the next developmental stage is coming and when it will be over.&#34; (Sarah Beck). ---&#34;The woman who reviewed this book for the Library Journal has clearly never had an infant who acts fine one week and then crazy the next. If she had, she&#39;d love this book as much as I did, and the 3 friends I&#39;ve given this book as gifts too did. The reason the authors don&#39;t refer to other research studies is that they&#39;re the only ones who&#39;ve specifically been studying this, and they use plenty of examples from their own research. Yes, it&#39;s true that it&#39;s not written in a really scientific way, but is that what you want to read when you&#39;re just trying to figure out why your child stopped sleeping and eating all of a sudden? Not me. I&#39;d rather know what developmental leap is coming up so I know how long the cranky phase will last and what I can do to help my child through it. This book is so easily worth the money and time spent reading it, just because it gives you the patience to be able to wait out difficult periods when you know why they&#39;re happening and when they&#39;ll stop. No things you should and shouldn&#39;t do, just a sort of reference manual of what&#39;s going on and why. Buy the book and your life with your infant through 12-month-old will improve immensely.&#34; ---&#34;I bought this book when my first baby was 8 weeks old and right in the middle of an extremely fussy stage. For a whole week he was crying everyday, had to be held, restless, not sleeping well and not eating well. After talking with his pediatrician who told me he&#39;s just fussy I wanted more answers. I searched online &#34;very fussy 8 week old baby&#34; and this book came up. I read lots of reviews and decided to buy it. Lots of the reviews say the book is repetitive. I loved the book. In my opinion when you are as sleep deprived as new parents are you forget things and the reminders - aka repetition - in each chapter from the chapters before are very helpful to me. I thought this book was excellent. It helped me realize that my baby was going through a wonderful transition and a special milestone and I was able to embrace it with confidence that there was nothing wrong with him or me. I highly recommend this book, it WILL give you a piece of mind and turn something scary and frustrating into something to celebrate.&#34; ---&#34;My son is famous among parents of similar-age babies we know for being the most cheerful, non-fussy baby there ever was. But even he gets more Challenging during the wonder weeks. We&#39;re going through the week 46 one now (which actually starts earlier than that and can last several weeks) and it&#39;s the worst one yet. He normally falls asleep within 5 minutes with no fuss and now it takes him 30 minutes to 2 hours to fall asleep. And no, not because he&#39;s not tired. He&#39;s totally tired, in fact he&#39;s overtired due to his sleep troubles. He&#39;s regressed in some of his physical abilities too, wanting to just lay around and chew on things a lot of times. He&#39;s moody. All of this would have concerned me so much I&#39;d have gone to the doctor if I didn&#39;t have this book a friend loaned me. I didn&#39;t read every word cover to cover, like others I think this book could be half the size, but it&#39;s been so helpful even just to know there&#39;s nothing wrong that I would encourage parents-to-be to get this book and be aware of what to expect before the baby arrives. If we&#39;d had this book from the start we would not have been going so crazy during those first couple cognitive spurts when things went haywire.&#34; (Lulu McBride). ---&#34;Every new parent should read this book. It gives remarkable insight on what is happening with your baby. My son has reached every &#39;wonder week&#39; so far and exhibited the behaviors and emotions listed in this book. It has really helped save my sanity just knowing what is happening with him and why he suddenly cries more often, doesn&#39;t sleep through the night anymore, etc. Also, knowing it is just temporary is great. I have been able to relax and really enjoy watching the developmental progress going on through the changes in his behavior.&#34; (C. Breed). ---&#34;Really want an iphone now so I can get the @TheWonderWeeks app. So much to learn!&#34; (@dimplescfg). ---&#34;Welcome to Twitter, @thewonderweeks!

How to stimulate your baby's mental development and help him turn his 10 predictable, great, fussy phases into magical leaps forward</i> describes in easy-to-understand terms the incredible developmental changes that all babies go through during the first 20 months of their lives. <p>This is the extended, "fat" edition with 2 more chapters covering 2 more leaps in the mental development of your baby up to the end of the sensorimotor period.</p><p>The book is based on the discovery of a little known phenomenon: all normal, healthy babies appear to be more tearful, troublesome, demanding and clingy at very nearly the same ages. </p><p>These age-related fluctuations in need for body contact and attention are related to major and quite dramatic changes in the brains of the children. These changes enable a baby to enter a whole new perceptual world and, as a consequence, to learn many new skills.

Children&#39;s book. Paperback, 6&#34; x 9&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Lust for Life (Plume Fiction)</h2><p>No artist has been more ruthlessly driven by his creative urge, nor more isolated by it from most ordinary sources of human happiness, than Vincent Van Gogh. A painter of genius, his life was an incessant struggle against poverty, discouragement, madness and despair. Lust for Life skilfully captures the exciting atmosphere of the Paris of the Post-Impressionists and reconstructs with great insight the development of Van Gogh&#39;s art. The painter is brought to life not only as an artist but as a personality and this account of his violent, vivid and tormented life is a novel of rare compassion and vitality.</p><p>12 1.5-hour cassettes<b>Irving Stone </b>was born in San Francisco in 1903. He wrote several books in a genre that he coined the &#x201c;biographical novel,&#x201d; which recounted the lives of well-known historical figures. In these novels, Stone interspersed biography with fictional narrative on the psychology and private lives of his subjects. He also wrote biographies of Clarence Darrow and Earl Warren, and short biographies of men who lost presidential elections. He died in 1989.</p><h2>More Home Cooking</h2><p><p><em>More Home Cooking,</em> like its predecessor, <em>Home Cooking,</em> is an expression of Laurie Colwin's lifelong passion for cuisine. In this delightful mix of recipes, advice, and anecdotes, she writes about often overlooked food items such as beets, pears, black beans, and chutney. With down-to-earth charm and wit, Colwin also discusses the many pleasures and problems of cooking at home in essays such as "Desserts That Quiver," "Turkey Angst," and "Catering on One Dollar a Head." As informative as it is entertaining, <em>More Home Cooking</em> is a delicious treat for anyone who loves to spend time in the kitchen.</p></p><p>Prior to her untimely death, Laurie Colwin&#39;s insightful novels developed something of a cult following, as did her good-humored food columns for Gourmet Magazine. This book, like its predecessor Home Cooking, is a result of her lifelong passion for wonderful food, often things one wouldn&#39;t immediately think of: beets, pears, black beans, chutney. More than a cookbook, it&#39;s like a conversation with a longtime neighbor--one who can reminisce all day about the great meals she&#39;s cooked and eaten; one who sees cooking as a wonderful adventure complete with a pot of Curried Broccoli Soup at the end of the rainbow. It&#39;s for reading in bed as well as in the kitchen.<p>Laurie Colwin is the author of five novels: <em>Happy All the Time</em>; <em>Family Happiness</em>; <em>Goodbye Without Leaving</em>; <em>Shine On, Bright and Dangerous Object</em>; and <em>A Big Storm Knocked It Over</em>; three collections of short stories: <em>Passion and Affect</em>, <em>Another Marvelous Thing</em>, and <em>The Lone Pilgrim</em>; and two collections of essays: <em>Home Cooking</em> and <em>More Home Cooking</em>. She died in 1992.</p></p><h2>The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage : The Official Style Guide Used by the Writers and Editors of the World&#39;s Most Authoritative Newspaper</h2><p>For anyone who writes--a short story or a business plan, a book report or a news report--knotty choices of spelling, grammar, punctuation and word meaning lurk in every line: Lay or lie? Who or whom? None is or none are? Is touch-tone a trademark? Is Day-Glo? It's enough to send you for a Martini. (Or is that a martini?)<br><br>Now everyone can find answers in the handy alphabetical guide used by the thousand journalists of the world's most authoritative newspaper. The guidelines to correct hyphenation, punctuation, capitalization and foreign and English spelling are crisp and compact, created for instant reference in the rush of deadlines. Rewritten for the first time in twenty-three years and greatly expanded since the last edition, the manual tackles issues that will follow writers into the new century:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;How to respect the equality of the sexes without self-conscious devices such as "he or she"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;How to choose thoughtfully between terms like African-American and black; Hispanic and Latino; American Indian and Native American<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;How to translate the vocabulary of e-mail and cyberspace for everyday readers, and how to cope with the eccentric capitalization and punctuation of Internet company names and Web site addresses<br><br>The authors have more than seventy years of combined newsroom experience, most of it at The Times. They recognize that our language is changing, but they tailor their responses to the paper's impression of its readership: "educated and sophisticated . . . traditional but not tradition-bound." <br><br>They counsel a fluid style, easygoing but not slangy, the unpretentious language of a letter to a literate friend. They invite readers of the manual to be precise while casting off the stodgy (among dozens of examples, writing before instead of the pompous prior to, and carry out instead of implement).<br><br>The authors also offer a thumbnail guide to newsroom ethics and standards in their entries on anonymous sources, attribution, fairness and obscenity. And they seed the rules with wry humor. (On vogue words: "Wannabe is the faddish slang of adults who, well, want to be teenagers." And about the late: "Do not fall into this error: Only the late Senator Miel opposed the bill. He was almost certainly alive at the time.")<br><br>For writers, editors, students, researchers and all who love language,<b> The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage</b> is an entertaining tool as well as an essential reference.</p><p>"A foolish consistency," Emerson insisted, "is the hobgoblin of little minds." That may well be, but editors have enough reasons to reject your work; don't let sloppy inconsistencies be one of them. <i>The New York Times Manual of Style &amp; Usage</i> was written for the paper's editors and writers, but it is a fine, up-to-date resource for anyone's use. Our language is ever-mutating, and a guide such as this will ensure that you understand the impact your words might have before they reach print. Should you use <i>Native Americans</i> or <i>American Indians</i>? <i>Debark</i> or <i>disembark</i>? Did you know that <i>thermos</i> is no longer a trademark, but that <i>Popsicle</i> and <i>Dumpster</i> are? Writing, when you get down to it, is nothing more than the careful choosing of words. This style book will ensure that you don't choose <i>carat</i> when you mean <i>karat</i>, <i>jury-rigged</i> when you want <i>jerry-built</i>, <i>chow chow</i> when <i>chowchow</i> is called for, or <i>V-8</i> when you could have had a <i>V8</i>. A naysayer may bridle against the strictures of such a rule book, but the authors believe "the rules should encourage thinking, not discourage it." Plus, "a rule," they say, "can shield against untidiness in detail that might make readers doubt large facts." We'd call the book "user-friendly," but that, we've learned, can be downright "reader-tiresome." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i><b>Allan M. Siega</b>l joined <i>The New York Times</i> in 1960.

The Dark Medieval world is fairly similiar to its counterpart in the real world, so if you want more information you can look into the history collections of your local library or bookstore. Although the end of the 12th century is the primary time in which Vampire: The Dark Ages is set, you can set your own chronicle in any era. Most of the information in this book applies to Europe up until the first stirrings of the Renais- sance, though the technology varries depending on the period.

She visits the small boy, Diamond, and takes him with her on her journeys, teaching him about herself. Through the eyes of an innocent and yet perceptive child, MacDonald explores North Wind as a way of exploring the place of death in our lives. He looks squarely at social injustice--he knew poverty and the poor first hand--and yet also sees that the deepest need we have is for love and forgiveness, which are rooted in eternity.<p> This is a book for children--I've read it to my own daughter more than once--even though they may not understand just who North Wind is until years later. Adults on the other hand will learn that while they thought they knew something about death, there is much to relearn--and probably the most important part. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p><b>George MacDonald </b>(1824&#x2014;1905) was a prolific writer, yet it is his fantasies for children that have survived.

Schulz.</p><p>Accomplished in many phases of cartooning, the prolific Gerberg shares the tricks of his trade in this updated and expanded edition of his Arbor House Book of Cartooning ( LJ 11/15/83). Part 1 is devoted to the familiar magazine or "gag" cartoon, seemingly his first love and a good base for discussion of other cartoon forms. Part 2 covers other earning opportunities, including comic strips, editorial cartoons, spot illustrations, animation, advertising, TV, comic books, greeting cards, and humor books. That he is at home in all these areas is evident in his anecdotes, advice, and art work and in his choice of work by other big names. Not an elaborate "how to draw" manual; the book's strength is in its historical background and wide-ranging lowdown on materials, marketing, and making contacts--in short, on how things are done by the pros.<br><i>- William A.

The characters who people the &#34;Wild West&#34; are interesting and vividly described. However, Murphey is not an inspired reader. He has a pleasant voice but fails to add drama or intensity with pacing or even changing volume. This work is not very suitable for audio as it is not action packed nor is there much dialogue.

The primary focus of her spiritual quest involves the wisdom of 13 "original clan mothers"--described as the 13 aspects of the feminine principle of life. Each clan mother represents a lesson in the development of feminine wisdom. Symbolic stories demonstrate the path to self-knowledge taken by each clan mother.

It was still dark as pitch, but when she rolled over to look at the clock it read six-fifteen. She'd slept in, it seemed. She clicked on the cordless. "June Hudson."<p>"Who was that man?" her eighty-four-year-old aunt Myrna wanted to know.</p><p>June glanced over her shoulder at the man in question. Jim. He yawned largely and began to scratch his chest. Ah. So she hadn't dreamt it after all. He was here, beside her, in the flesh, after being away so long.</p><p>Aunt Myrna wasn't the only one who knew nothing at all about her secret lover. With just a couple of exceptions, the whole town had been kept in the dark. She was going to have a lot of explaining to do.</p><p>"His name is Jim and I'm going to bring him over to meet you the first chance I get, Aunt Myrna. Hopefully this very morning. You're going to approve, I promise."</p><p>"Where's he from? What's he do?"</p><p>I haven't figured that out yet, June thought. "Later, darling. There are too many details and I have to get ready for work. I'll see you soon."</p><p>She disconnected and returned the phone to the bedside table. This time when she looked at Jim, she shook her head and sighed, but she smiled. The phone rang again. "I'm not on call," she said. "We'll let the machine pick up."</p><p>He lifted one brow, amused. "Too many details?" he mimicked.</p><p>"Yes, and we'll probably have to make them all up." She jumped out of bed, naked as the day she was born. "I'm going to shower. Would you listen to the messages, please? If anyone calls for emergency assistance, bring me the phone. Okay?"</p><p>From the kitchen came the sound of June's father's voice, lifelike enough to make her flinch and grab for the sheet to cover up. Elmer Hudson was one of the exceptions who knew, but he didn't know everything. "Well, you've really stirred up a hornet's nest this time, haven't you?" Elmer asked, then laughed his wheezy laugh. "I think I'll take my coffee at the cafï¿½ this morning, just to be on hand if there's any excitement."</p><p>"He's a character, isn't he?" Jim asked.</p><p>"A laugh a minute." June made a face. "See if you can think up a good story while I shower."</p><p>While she waited for the hot water, she looked at her profile in the mirror. Her waist was fast disappearing.</p><p>A year ago she was the thirty-seven-year-old town doctor, single and without a prospect in sight. Six months ago, though she had a hot prospect, she was pretty sure she'd be childless. A few months ago, her prospect became even more serious and words of love were said along with desperate goodbyes. Two weeks ago her tummy was reasonably flat, but the moment she found out she was four months pregnant, her middle began to strain at her waistband. Then, approximately the second Jim returned home for good, home for her, she blossomed. Now she had a nice little round belly growing.</p><p>Last night, as the weekend Harvest Festival was breaking up and the last revelers were dancing, he appeared out of nowhere. It was as though the entire festival, the entire town had disappeared, and it was only the two of them, embracing, touching, kissing. And then, without making any proper introductions, they'd gotten out of there as quickly as they could. But how naive. The town hadn't disappeared; the town had <i>watched. </i></p><p>She heard the phone ring again and knew the whole town was going to call her this morning, asking for the facts. She should probably be grateful they hadn't started calling last night.</p><p>The actual truth&#x2014;which they wouldn't be telling anyone&#x2014;was that June had met Jim last spring when he brought a wounded man to her clinic, late at night, wearing a disguise, and held a gun on her while she removed a bullet from his comrade's shoulder. Call it intuition, but she had never quite believed this big handsome man with the beautiful sparkling blue eyes could be a criminal, though he certainly appeared the part. Shortly thereafter, right about the same time she fell helplessly in love with him, he admitted the truth&#x2014; he was an undercover DEA agent, working inside a cannabis farm deep in the mountains, a farm they were getting ready to bust. After the raid, Jim was sent on one final assignment before retiring from a successful career in law enforcement. Neither June nor Jim realized they already had a baby started.</p><p>June, a small-town doctor raised by her father, the town doctor before her, was always busy thinking about the health and welfare of other people. Even though she'd been nauseous, sluggish and suffered through crying jags&#x2014;something she'd never before experi-enced&#x2014;she hadn't suspected a thing. By the time she described her symptoms to her business partner, John Stone, she was well along.</p><p>She got out of the shower and, while toweling dry, went into the bedroom. She wrapped the bath sheet around herself. Her wet hair hung in dripping curls to her shoulders. "Remember just before you left on that last assignment, I told you I thought I probably couldn't have children."</p><p>"I remember," he said, giving his head a nod. He was sitting up in the bed, sheet to his waist, and he held a cup of coffee. June's collie, Sadie, who was not allowed on the furniture, was curled up on the bed at his feet.</p><p>When she lifted her head to regard June, she seemed to have taken on regal airs. "Shows what you know," he said.</p><p>"I was already pregnant. I just realized that."</p><p>"For a doctor, you don't pay such close attention to details."</p><p>"Well, about other people I do. You made coffee?"</p><p>"Uh-huh. And squeezed Sadie over the grass and gave her breakfast."</p><p>"You just might come in handy. But before you get too comfortable, you're going to have to come into town with me. You need to meet a few people. We don't have a lot of time to waste."</p><p>"Why's that?"</p><p>She slowly opened the bath sheet. There it was, a protuberance that, much too soon, would be screaming for her supper. His eyes grew warm as they caressed her new shape. "It's time you met my family and friends," she said.</p><p>"Maybe you should take the day off," he suggested. "We could go to Reno or Lake Tahoe. Get married."</p><p>Suddenly, inexplicably, she felt her face grow hot. <i>Married? </i>Right away? What did she really know about him, besides that she loved him madly and he snored? So much was still a mystery. She wasn't about to marry him before she had a few more details.</p><p>But she wasn't about to start their relationship off on the wrong foot, by refusing his very chivalrous suggestion. She leaned across the bed and gave him a quick kiss. "It's too late to be coy, Jim. Tell me, how are we going to describe our...<i>courtship. </i>As it were."</p><p>He rubbed her cheek with the knuckle of his index finger. "I've found that the fewer the number of lies, the less complicated the cover. So, try this. I used to work in law enforcement back East and am retiring here, out West. I met you early last spring when I happened to be in the area and gave a friend a ride to the clinic for medical treatment for a minor injury."</p><p>"But he was a criminal! A drug farmer!"</p><p>Jim shrugged. "Yeah...but we were friends. Or so he thought."</p><p>"Ah, so that's how it works," she said. She sat on the bed, her legs curled under her, like a girl waiting for more of the story. The phone rang and they both paused and listened. Into the machine they could hear Dr. John Stone. "Hi, June. Just wondered if you're taking the day off. Or at least the morning. I can handle the clinic alone if you have...ah...other things to do. Heh-heh-heh."</p><p>"Smart-ass," she said to herself. Then, "So, Mr. Post, what kind of law enforcement?"</p><p>"In twenty years...a little of everything. In the last few years, more paperwork than anything else."</p><p>"Is that true?" she asked.</p><p>He nodded. "Unfortunately."</p><p>"And what have you been doing out here?"</p><p>"Scouting around for a place to settle. Grace Valley might have been a contender even if I hadn't fallen for the town's doctor."</p><p>"You know," she said, impressed, "you're very good at this."</p><p>He leaned toward her. "I'm a professional. Or was."</p><p>"How am I going to know when you're lying to me?"</p><p>He reached for her and, putting his large hand on the back of her neck under her wet hair, pulled her to him. He kissed her gently. "For some reason I can't explain, you have always known the truth about me. The only other person with whom that is true is my sister, Annie." He smiled. "I feel differently about you than I do about her."</p><p>"Well, that's a relief." She bounced off the bed. "You can have the shower. And hurry up. Let's get going before the town has any more fun with this."</p><p>June and Jim rode toward town in her little pickup truck. Sadie usually had the seat Jim was occupying, and June wouldn't even talk about putting her in the back, so Sadie was squished between them. June dialed up John on her cell phone.</p><p>"I just wanted to let you know I'm on my way into town and I'm bringing my...my...I'm bringing Jim with me so everyone can look him over and give him the stamp of approval."</p><p>"Why, June," John said, feigning hurt. "I'm sure the man of your choice is none of our business."</p><p>"I wish," she answered, and laughed in spite of herself.</p><p>June slowed as she came around a curve and encountered a disabled truck up on a jack by the side of the road, its left rear tire missing. The vehicle was old and overladen with bundles, boxes and a couple of child-size mattresses. Two little kids, either girls or boys who hadn't had haircuts in forever, stood behind the pickup. They were ratty-looking and dirty and wore forlorn expressions. They didn't wear jackets, though the early morning air was cold. If they were underdressed, there was a good chance they were also underfed.</p><p>There was no tarp to cover the family's goods and the sky was threatening. It was October and soon the rains of winter would begin and not ease up until late spring.</p><p>A family of modest means, all their worldly goods loaded in a truck, trying to find a place to start over, was not an unusual sight on the roads surrounding the valley. With the cold weather came the cessation of logging and a slowdown in construction. Farmers would let their temporary workers go and peo...</p></p><h2>The Good Old Boys: A Hewey Calloway Novel (Hewey Calloway, 2)</h2><p><p>Hewey Calloway has a problem. In his West Texas home of 1906, the land of the way of life that he loves are changing too quickly for his taste.</p><p>Hewey dreams of freedom--he wants only to be a footloose horseback cowboy, endlessly wandering the open range. But the open range of his childhood is slowly disappearing: land is being parceled out, and barbed-wire fences are spring up all over. As if that weren't enough, cars and other machines are invading Hewey's simple cowboy life, stinking up the area and threatening to replace horse travel. As Hewey struggles against the relentless stream of "progress", he comes to realize that the simple life of his childhood is gone, that a man can't live a life whose time has passed, and that every choice he makes--even those that lead to happiness--requires a sacrifice.</p></p><p>"<i>The Good Old Boys</i> is probably the closest I have ever come to writing from sheer inspiration. Hewey Calloway and the other characters took hold of the story like a cold-jawed horse grabbing onto the bit, and about all I could do was hang on for the ride." --Elmer Kelton<p><b>Elmer Kelton</b> (1926-2009) was the award-winning author of more than forty novels, including <i>The Time It Never Rained</i>, <i>Other Men's Horses</i>, <i>Texas Standoff</i> and <i>Hard Trail to Follow</i>.

Written around 36,000 B.C. by Thoth, an Atlantean priest-king, this manuscript dates far back beyond reach of any Egyptian writings ever found. The author, Thoth, a Master-Teacher of the early Egyptians, put this treatise to writing in his native Atlantean language and Dr. Doreal, by use of his expertise as an Occultist and Master of time and space, was given the directive to retrieve these Tablets and translate them into English for the edification of modern man. The powerful and rhythmic verse of Thoth is wonderfully retained in Doreal&#39;s translation. Contained within the pages of Thoth&#39;s masterpiece of Spiritual and Occult Wisdom is the synthesis of the Ancient Wisdom Teachings, the guideline for initiates of all ages, revealing the Knowledge and Wisdom hitherto held secret, but now in this New Age, revealed to all Seekers on the Path of Light.

It is an outfit so secret that only a handful of people know it exists, and some of those people have names like Churchill and Roosevelt. The mission of Watrehouse and Detatchment 2702-commanded by Marine Raider Bobby Shaftoe-is to keep the Nazis ignorant of the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy&#39;s fabled Enigma code. It is a game, a cryptographic chess match between Waterhouse and his German counterpart, translated into action by the gung-ho Shaftoe and his forces.Fast-forward to the present, where Waterhouse&#39;s crypto-hacker grandson, Randy, is attempting to create a &#34;data haven&#34; in S</p><p>Neal Stephenson enjoys cult status among science fiction fans and techie types thanks to <i>Snow Crash</i>, which so completely redefined conventional notions of the high-tech future that it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. But if his cyberpunk classic was big, <i>Cryptonomicon</i> is huge... gargantuan... massive, not just in size (a hefty 918 pages including appendices) but in scope and appeal. It's the hip, readable heir to <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> and the Illuminatus trilogy. And it's only the first of a proposed series--for more information, read our interview with Stephenson.<p> <i>Cryptonomicon</i> zooms all over the world, careening conspiratorially back and forth between two time periods--World War II and the present. Our 1940s heroes are the brilliant mathematician Lawrence Waterhouse, cryptanalyst extraordinaire, and gung ho, morphine-addicted marine Bobby Shaftoe. They're part of Detachment 2702, an Allied group trying to break Axis communication codes while simultaneously preventing the enemy from figuring out that their codes have been broken. Their job boils down to layer upon layer of deception. Dr. Alan Turing is also a member of 2702, and he explains the unit's strange workings to Waterhouse. "When we want to sink a convoy, we send out an observation plane first.... Of course, to observe is not its <i>real</i> duty--we already know exactly where the convoy is. Its <i>real</i> duty is <i>to be observed</i>.... Then, when we come round and sink them, the Germans will not find it suspicious."</p><p> All of this secrecy resonates in the present-day story line, in which the grandchildren of the WWII heroes--inimitable programming geek Randy Waterhouse and the lovely and powerful Amy Shaftoe--team up to help create an offshore data haven in Southeast Asia and maybe uncover some gold once destined for Nazi coffers. To top off the paranoiac tone of the book, the mysterious Enoch Root, key member of Detachment 2702 and the <i>Societas Eruditorum</i>, pops up with an unbreakable encryption scheme left over from WWII to befuddle the 1990s protagonists with conspiratorial ties. </p><p> <i>Cryptonomicon</i> is vintage Stephenson from start to finish: short on plot, but long on detail so precise it's exhausting. Every page has a math problem, a quotable in-joke, an amazing idea, or a bit of sharp prose. <i>Cryptonomicon</i> is also packed with truly weird characters, funky tech, and crypto--all the crypto you'll ever need, in fact, not to mention all the computer jargon of the moment.

Six months later, Captain Gavin Elliott drops anchor at the island of Maduri and is shocked to find a European woman being auctioned in the slave market. Alex clings to hope when the handsome sea captain offers to buy her, but the ruling Sultan of Maduri has plans for Gavin and shrewdly views Alex's plight as a means to control him. Through strength, courage, and wisdom, Gavin thwarts the Sultan's plans, but after surviving the dangers of the South Seas, Alex and Gavin are faced with a more lethal threat when they arrive in London. This time, whether either of them will survive the evil that threatens their lives is anyone's guess.</p><p> The exotic locale of the East Indies contrasts vividly with polite London society in this third tale in Ms. Putney's trilogy (<i>The Wild Child</i> and <i>The China Bride</i>). The plot has enough twists and turns to satisfy the most devoted of mystery fans while the relationship between hero and heroine is complicated and the secondary characters well drawn.

Sleek and silvery, an astonishing leaper, paradoxical in his habits and behavior and electrifying when hooked, Salmo salar is the ultimate angling quarry. And now, at last, we have a thoroughly revised and updated version of the classic 1958 book on this great game fish by one of the world's leading anglers. It is graced by scores of new photographs, drawings by the author, and several important new chapters. Lee Wulff provides expert advice on all phases of this great sport - tackle, casting, presentation of both wet and dry flies, fly selection, wading, where fish lie and how to make them strike, and how best to land salmon. (Much of what Wulff says is applicable to all forms of fly fishing.) There are shrewd and telling observations on the biology and ecology of the salmon, and strong, measured advice on how salmon fishing can be protected and improved, so that thousands of new anglers can share the pleasures of this exciting brand of fishing. Throughout the book, there is a wealth of fascinating stories from the author's fifty years of salmon fishing throughout the world - and at the end, a stirring new account of Wulff's pioneering flights, in the thirties, in a single-engine plane, in search of salmon. Not merely for those who have fished for salmon but for the legions of fly fishermen who dream of doing so and who may eventually realize their dreams, The Atlantic Salmon is a rich, classic book not to be missed.<br><i>"Everything from the fish's natural history to what makes it rise and how to catch it."--</i>Fly Fisherman<i> </i><br></p><h2>Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea</h2><p><p><strong> In this dazzling companion volume to a seven&#x2013;part SBS series (airing November 2002), an award winning journalist collaborates with leading scholars in the life sciences (Stephen Jay Gould, Sarah Hrdy, Mary&#x2013;Claire King, Steven Pinker, etc.) to tell the compelling story of the theory of evolution starting with Darwin's seminal insights and ending with the cutting&#x2013;edge developments in 20th century science that have confirmed and extended his findings.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong>In this remarkable new book, a rich and up&#x2013;to&#x2013;date view of evolution is presented that explores the far&#x2013;reaching implications of Darwin's theory. In a world where species loss is escalating, there are growing pressures on food production and energy resources, and lethal antibiotic&#x2013;resistant diseases are running rampant, evolution becomes a way of grappling both with our planet's past and it's future. </p><p> At a time when controversies surrounding creationism and education are bursting into public consciousness, this book's emphasis on the power, significance, and relevance of evolution will make it a catalyst for public debate. EVOLUTION, the book and the series, marks a turning point in the 150&#x2013;year debate and will be an indispensable asset to any serious reader with an interest in the life sciences, a passion for truth in education, or a concern for the future of the planet.</p><p> </p></p><p>While its opponents may sneer that "it's just a theory," evolution has transcended that label to take its place as one of the most important ideas in human history. Science journalist Carl Zimmer explores its history and future in <i>Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea</i>, a companion piece to the epic PBS series of the same name. The book, lavishly illustrated with photos of our distant cousins, anatomical diagrams, and timelines, is as beautiful as it is enlightening. While those closely following the field will find little more here than a well-written summation of the state of the art in 2001, readers who have watched the evolutionary debates from a distance will quickly catch up with the details of the principal arguments.<p> Zimmer's text is fresh and expansive, explaining both the minutiae of comparative anatomy and the grand scale of geological time with verve and clarity. Following the trend of turn-of-the-century evolution writers, he treats the religious beliefs of creationists with respect, while firmly insisting that the scientific evidence against their position is too compelling to ignore. Touching on biology, philosophy, theology, politics, and nearly every other field of human thought, <i>Evolution</i> will inspire its readers with the elegance and importance of Darwin's simple theory. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><p>Carl Zimmer is the author of three well-received books on evolution.

David Peat went to the Blackfoot Sun Dance ceremony in Alberta, Canada. Having spent all his life steeped in and influenced by linear Western science, he was entranced by the Native American worldview and, through dialogue circles between scientists and Native Elders, he began to explore it in greater depth. <p>"Blackfoot Physics" is the account of his discoveries. In an edifying synthesis of anthropology, history, metaphysics, cosmology and quantum theory, Peat compares the medicines, the myths, the languages, indeed the entire perceptions of reality of the Western and indigenous peoples. What becomes apparent is the amazing resemblance between indigenous teachings and some of the insights that are emerging from modern science, a congruence that is as enlightening about the physical universe as it is about the circular evolution of humanity's understanding. Through Peat's insightful observations, he extends our understanding of ourselves, our understanding of the universe, and how the two intersect in a meaningful vision of human life in relation to a greater reality. </p><p>"Blackfoot Physics" is a book that will captivate anyone with an interest in the relationship between science, spirituality, and the different ways of knowing.</p></p><p>Born in a suburb of Liverpool, England, just before the Second World War, David Peat remembers frequent trips to the damp and smelly air raid shelter. His interest in science was awakened by the magnesium casings of incendiary bombs--the magnesium could be lit by playing a bunsen burner on it. This interest was strengthened by his physics teacher at school, who encouraged his pupils to work things out from first principles. Peat frequented the Cavern jazz club in Liverpool, but didn't take the new beat groups who began to appear there (including the Beatles) too seriously. <p>Interest in experimental physics gave way to theoretical and philosophical concerns in such areas as quantum theory. Density matrices brought him to Canada, where he stayed 30 years, teaching and writing and following the work of thinker David Bohm.</p></p><h2>What Does God Want?: A Practical Guide to Making Decisions</h2><p>This book is designed to help you make these decisions.

If we could assume the viewpoint of nonhuman nature, what passes for sane behavior in our social affairs might seem madness. But as the prevailing Reality Principle would have it, nothing could be greater madness than to believe that beast and plant, mountain and river have a 'point of view.'"<br>The Voice of the Earth seeks to bridge this centuries-old split between the psychological and the ecological. A true "ecopsychology," Roszak insists, sees the needs of the planet and the needs of the person as a continuum. In a sense that weaves science and psychiatry, poetry and politics together, he shows that the ecological priorities of the biosphere are coming to be expressed through our most private emotional and spiritual travail. The Earth's cry for rescue from the punishing weight of the industrial system we have created is our own cry for a scale and quality of life that will free us to become the whole and healthy person that more and more members of our species are coming to believe we were born to be.</p><p>Theodore Roszak is the author of The Making of a Counterculture, Where the Wasteland Ends, The Gendered Atom, and other works of nonfiction. His novels include Flicker and The Memoirs of Elizabeth Frankenstein, which is currently being made into a motion picture. Roszak lives in Berkeley and is professor of history at California State University, Hayward. A Guggenheim Fellowship recipient, he has twice been nominated for the National Book Award.Repeatedly, in this scholarly survey of cultural history, Roszak (History/California State Univ.; Flicker, 1991, etc.) evokes a back-to-nature philosophy, contrasting the rational philosophy of the Enlightenment with the romanticism of the noble savage; prehistoric animism and earth-mother religion with the rise of patriarchy and male-dominated, nature-dominating religion. All this by way of elaborating what he sees as the only salvation of the ecological crisis: a new ``ecopsychology.'' The new school celebrates the individual, seen in harmonious interrelationships with the family, society, Mother Earth, and, ultimately, the cosmos. Ecopsychology is informed by various post- Freudian schools: some Jung (collective unconscious), and something of Reich, Maslow, Gestalt psychology, and various California-style movements--in general, those schools that look upon the unconscious as the well-spring of creativity. ``The core of the mind is the ecological unconscious,'' Roszak says, containing ``the living record of cosmic evolution, tracing back to distant initial conditions in the history of time.'' Yes, time's arrow and the evolution of the cosmos figure large in Roszak's philosophy. Taking the Big Bang as a given, and borrowing arguments from systems theory, the Gaia hypothesis, and the anthropic principle, he sees the emergence of humanity as inevitable in the grand scheme of things. It follows, then, that we must get back on track with Mother Earth. How to do this finds Roszak lamenting urban- industrial society. Cities are bad. Deep ecology is good. The restorative work must begin in childhood, and must involve a breaking away from macho ideas and the invoking of some concepts of ecofeminism. Roszak turns a fine sentence and knows his history (if not his science), but his idealism pays no mind to the population problem, poverty, disease, or rising racial-ethnic conflicts; and it dismisses the cultural largesse of cities and pays scant homage to what science and technology might do. In short, there seems to be more wish than reality here. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

There is an intensely biblical quality to his pastoral teaching and he has demonstrated a keen concern for the authentic interpretation of sacred Scripture.<br><br>Here a foremost interpreter of Catholic thought and life offers a probing look at Benedict's biblical theology and provides a clear and concise introduction to his life and work. Bestselling author and theologian Scott Hahn argues that the heart of Benedict's theology is salvation history and the Bible and shows how Benedict accepts historical criticism but recognizes its limits. The author also explains how Benedict reads the overall narrative of Scripture and how he puts it to work in theology, liturgy, and Christian discipleship.</p><p>"Hahn here renders an important service in so clearly setting forth the hermeneutical principles, biblical framework, and doctrinal positions of Pope Benedict XVI, arguably the world's most important contemporary theologian. The parallels between the biblical theology of the pope and of evangelicals, together with their respective attempts to interpret Scripture theologically in an age marked by modern biblical criticism, are particularly fascinating."--<b>Kevin J. Vanhoozer</b>, Wheaton College and Graduate School<br><br>"A compelling manuduction right into the very core of Pope Benedict XVI's theological vision. In this clearly written and cogently argued essay, Hahn makes a convincing and highly pertinent case for what Pope Benedict holds to be the crucial challenge for the Church and theology today--the reunification, and thereby the renewal, of exegesis theologically conceived and theology exegetically grounded. Theologically insightful and surefooted, this book is one of the best and certainly the most timely and urgent among the recent introductions to the theology of Pope Benedict XVI."--<b>Reinhard Hï¿½tter</b>, Duke Divinity School<br><br>"As a Protestant biblical scholar, I found Hahn's exposition of Pope Benedict's biblical theology both informative and inspiring. In spite of differences, Protestants need to read this book to understand how deeply we can agree on the primacy of Christ and the Word. Through Hahn, I have a new appreciation for the mind and heart of Pope Benedict."--<b>Tremper Longman III</b>, Westmont College<br><br>"This lucid exposition introduces the reader to Benedict's understanding of historical criticism, faith and reason, typology, covenant, sacrifice, liturgy, and a variety of other topics. The book beautifully models what for Pope Benedict is the central task of theology: it leads believers into a real participation in the mystery of faith."--<b>Hans Boersma</b>, Regent College<br><br>"This is essential reading for any informed Catholic. I have been waiting for someone to expand and bring together the conclusion that Pope Benedict XVI brings to us in his powerful book Jesus of Nazareth. This is a very important book for all Catholics, clergy, religious, and laity alike."--<b>Benedict J. Groeschel, CFR<br><br></b>"This is an extraordinary book. More than an introduction to Ratzinger / Benedict's theology--although it is this as well--Hahn's marvelous book provides an introduction to biblical exegesis, Catholic theology, and ultimately to the life of discipleship itself. This is a book for all readers, a rich feast of spiritual and intellectual transformation."--<b>Matthew Levering</b>, University of Dayton<br><br>"Even when one disagrees with some of his conclusions, Benedict's insights, as well as his engagement with critical scholarship, offer a wealth of reflection. In this remarkable book, Hahn has drawn out the central themes of Benedict's teaching in a highly readable summary. An eminently useful guide for introducing the thought of an important theologian of our time."--<b>Michael S. Horton</b>, Westminster Seminary California"Leading men and women to God, to the God who speaks in the Bible: this is the supreme and fundamental priority of the Church and of the Successor of Peter at the present time."--<b>Pope Benedict XVI<br><br></b>"A superb introduction to the way in which the theology of Pope Benedict XVI has been shaped by the Bible. Scott Hahn's crisp and clear analysis puts the reader at the very center of this remarkable pope's thought."--<b>Gary Anderson</b>, University of Notre Dame<br><br>"The increasingly painful bankruptcy of the historical-critical method in our time has created a vacuum precisely at the point where the living Church requires substantial nurture. Pope Benedict XVI has spoken into this crisis like no one else, and his best expositor, Scott Hahn, has done us a tremendous service by synthesizing Benedict's erudite and prayerful biblical theology into a lively, readable, and intellectually reliable conspectus. This excellent volume will be indispensable for all Christians who seek to be more maturely grounded in Scripture."--<b>David Lyle Jeffrey</b>, Baylor University<br><br>"A lucidly written and trenchant study of the biblical theology of Joseph Ratzinger / Pope Benedict. Hahn shows how one of the most important theologians of the twentieth century gently but firmly corrected the historical critics who dominate much of contemporary academic Scripture study. Hahn further demonstrates how, in making this correction, Ratzinger / Benedict allowed for the recovery of much of the richness of patristic biblical interpretation. This is a beautiful and thought-provoking text, one that will prove helpful to any serious student of the sacred page."--<b>Robert Barron</b>, Mundelein Seminary, University of St. Mary of the Lake<br><br>"In the growing body of literature on the theology of Benedict XVI, there is a conspicuously missing theme: the consciously biblical character of the pontiff's theology. Hahn places Ratzinger / Benedict's concern for theology as a scriptural--and hence a liturgical--activity center stage with the verve and clarity we have come to expect from him. Hahn uses his encyclopedic knowledge of Ratzinger / Benedict's corpus to tease out many threads, weaving them into a compelling account of the new hermeneutic at the heart of Benedict's vision. Not only students of the pope but also all of us who desire the revitalization of theology and exegesis should welcome the passion and insight that Hahn has brought to bear on his subject."--<b>Lewis Ayres</b>, Durham University</p><h2>Chihuly over Venice</h2><p>Bound like an artist&#39;s sketchbook with a tipped-in image of a Venice Canal, gondola and glass sculpture, &#34;Chihuly over Venice&#34; documents the culmination of this amazing artistic odyssey that took the artist from his Seattle Boathouse hot shop to Nuutajarvi, Finland; Waterford, Ireland; Monterrey, Mexico; and finally Venice.

A portal into these worlds of mysterious rites, ancient customs, and fantastic finery, AFRICAN KINGS takes us into the inner circle of 70 of these tribes in the person of their king. Gorgeous formal portraits of each king, in full regalia, are accompanied by brief biographies and historical notes on the tribe and the rituals and history associated with each ruler. AFRICAN KINGS introduces us to a way of life rarely glimpsed, with anthropological roots as deep as any on the earth, as they make the transition into a new millennium. Includes a historical introduction that provides an overview of the king's role in African tribes.</p><p>DANIEL LAINE is a former storekeeper, professor, and hotel concierge turned photographer. Between 1988 and 1991 he made twelve trips to Africa to create the collection of photographs in this book. He lives in France.From 1988 to 1991, Laine photographed 70 African monarchs "whose dynasties marked the history of Africa until the middle of the twentieth century." With hundreds of monarchs to choose from, Laine focused on those who continued to "retain a traditional and spiritual authority that is difficult for the Western mind to comprehend." Laine recalls the difficulties of getting permission for the photographs, the sensitive diplomatic negotiations involved in many cases. A war in Sudan prevented Laine from photographing the king of Shiluk, a descendant of black dynasties that ruled Egypt. Others, including the king of Swaziland, declined to be photographed. With each striking photograph, Laine provides a brief biography and historical notes about the tribe and its rituals. Among those photographed are Chukumela Nnam Obi II, the Oba of Ogba, Nigeria; El Hadj Sheehu Idris, emir of Zaria, Nigeria; and Goodwill Zwelethini, king of the Zulu, South Africa. The book includes historical background by Pierre Alexandre on the origins and significance of African kingdoms. <i>Vanessa Bush</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Merwin, Thomas McGrath, Robert Lowell, James Dickey, Galway Kinnell, and Donald Hall</p><p>The overriding question posed in poet Bly's ( Selected Poems ) collection of essays is, "Where do we go to find poetry that flies?" The book reflects 30 years of musing on the answers, with specific reference to contemporary American poetry (though few women are welcomed as members of this club). The volume is divided into three parts. "Looking for Dragon Smoke" compiles the various platforms and philosophies of Bly's magazine The Fifties, The Sixties and The Seventies. "The Bread of This World: Twelve Contemporary Poets," showing Bly at his most inspired, concentrates on individual poets--James Wright, Robert Lowell, Denise Levertov and nine others. "Educating the Rider and the Horse" consists of essays charting the direction of poetry and examining the relationship of intellect, politics, form and, most important, "wildness" to the genre. Throughout, Bly criticizes American poets for their willingness to abandon inward contemplation: "Poetry without inwardness or revolutionary feeling has no choice but to end in a kind of fabricated grossness," he argues. Provocative and opinionated at their best, Bly's inside views are without exception seriously considered. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Last Night I Sang to the Monster</h2><p><p>"Sï¿½enz' poetic narrative will captivate readers from the first sentence to the last paragraph of this beautifully written novel. . . .

After studying with Kenneth Hayes Miller and Reginald Marsh at the Art Students League, Vickrey went on to Yale, where he learned egg tempera from Lewis E. York. The rediscovery of Cennino d&#39;Andrea Cennini&#39;s Il Libro dell&#39;Arte (c. 1390-1410) was highly influential. The Brandywine River Museum&#39;s 2002 exhibition &#34;Milk and Eggs: The American Revival of Tempera Painting, 1930-1950&#34; chronicled the experiments of the era. Vickrey wrote his own manuals on the subject: New Techniques in Egg Tempera (1973), which author Eliasoph calls &#34;an instant classic in the field of technical art books,&#34; and Robert Vickrey: Artist at Work (1979). Eliasoph quotes Vickrey on reinvigorating the old medium: &#34;There are many ways to use egg tempera, not just one. And with a lot of practice and some imagination, you should be able to come up with techniques I&#39;ve never thought of.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Free-Motion Machine Quilting: From Practice to Perfection -- Troubleshooting Guide -- 50+ Designs</h2><p>Mr. Quilt will teach your quilters how to machine quilt like a pro! Get professional-looking results on a home sewing machine with new techniques for drawing and stitching quilt designs. From needle to thread, Mr. Quilt walks you through every aspect of free-motion machine quilting.</p><p>Don Linn lives in Redding, California, with his wife and high school sweetheart, Donna. He and Donna have a grown son and daughter who also live in California. Since childhood, Don has loved to make things and to work with his hands. His first sewing projects involved automobile upholstery and making clothes for himself and his wife while in college. Don had an entire career working in various manufacturing facilities as a draftsman. It was here that he dealt with a wide array of geometric shapes while doing machine design work before returning to college. After college he worked in upper management in both the forest products industry and the precast concrete industry. During this time he drew upon his experience as a draftsman in designing machinery and doing production drawings. Don&#39;s journey in quilting began after a corporate downsizing. He started out with a longarm machine and not a clue how to operate it. Since then, he has taught himself how to machine quilt, design, and piece quilts. He is now a well-known teacher of machine quilting and piecing classes.June 11 Free-Motion Machine Quilting by Don Linn Are you a member of the totally terrified group when the words 'free-motion quilting' are uttered? Don Linn, otherwise known as Mr. Quilt will take you on a journey where you can refine your free-motion skills, master a variety of techniques, which include perfectly stitched points, absolutely straight lines, and smooth curves, and help you along the way with a visual trouble shooting guide to common machine quilting problems. Take a deep breath and prove that you CAN quilt it yourself. * Fabrications * June 11 Homespun's Favourite Free-Motion Machine Quilting by Don Linn Look past the world's most boring front cover and turn the pages of this fabulous book to acquire, then hone, skills in free-motion quilting. This is a real workshop on paper. Don begins with advice about tools, supplies and workspace - not terribly exciting but very important for your success - and then moves on to some graded exercises, illustrated with good-quality photographs and accompanied by notes on some of the common problems that beginners encounter with free-motion quilting. And that's one of the things that makes this book especially good: Don doesn't pretend that you'll sit down in front of your sewing machine, follow his instructions and immediately start free-motion quilting like an expert. No doubt his experience in conducting face-to-face workshops has shown him that most people stumble at first, so his book patiently explains how to address the most common problems. He's also included some guidelines for quilting more complex designs and a gallery of his quilts that highlights different styles of free-motion quilting. * Australian Homespun * June 11 I'd like to be a great machine quilter. But, I don't want to practice all that much. Silly, I know. After reading Don Linn's Free-Motion Machine Quilting, I'm thinking there might be hope for me. I may not become e a great machine quilter, but possibly an OK machine quilter and certainly not without practice! The step-by-step photos and straight forward text offering advice such as ..."If you do not move the fabric after the machine has taken 3 or 4 stitches, the thread will probably break, and you will have to start over again..." give me hope. Don hands out homework that he calls "Practice Exercise." He shows you what problems look like (tension problems, stitch length problems) and then tells you how to solve them. His writing style is chatty, as if you have a quilting coach right in the room with you. Don patiently walks you through learning to draw and stitch designs one baby-step at a time, until suddenly you understand how to stitch feathers. You learn how to select designs that are appropriate for your quilt, and how to mark the quilt top. He provides inspiring photos of finished quilts and an eight-page quilting design gallery filled with designs to be enlarged to fit your quilt blocks. * American Patchwork &amp; Quilting *</p><h2>Sex &amp; Citizenship in Antebellum America (Gender &amp; American Culture)</h2><p>With this book, Nancy Isenberg illuminates the origins of the</p><p>"Isenberg has a finely honed sense of the ironies that emerged within the antebellum polity, which she illustrates to great benefit."-- <i>American Quarterly</i> <br>Illuminates the origins of American feminism by showing how antebellum feminists moved beyond suffrage to influence thinking about the nature of citizenship and rights more generally.</p><h2>Before The Storm: Memories of My Youth in Old Prussia</h2><p>A German newspaperwoman recounts her girlhood in a noble family in East Prussia and her escape from the Russians</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: GermanThe author grew up on her family's estate in pre-World War II East Prussia, lost to the Soviets in 1945.

At the end of the war Donhoff fled on horseback to West Germany, and in time became editor and then publisher of the leading newspaper Die Zeit . A foreward by George F.

Cox laid the groundwork for modern religious writing with his 1965 classic, <em>The Secular City</em>, paving the way for writers like Diana Butler Bass, Karen Armstrong, Stephen Prothero, and Deepak Chopra, who calls <em>The Future of Faith</em> &#x201c;a fresh vision for the resurrection of a new global Christianity.&#x201d; </p></p><p><p>Legendary Harvard religion scholar Harvey Cox offers up a new interpretation of the history and future of religion. Cox identifies three fundamental shifts over the last 2,000 years of church history:</p><p> The Age of Faith was when the early church was more concerned with following Jesus' teachings than enforcing what to believe about Jesus.</p><p> The Age of Belief marks a significant shift-between the fourth and twentieth centuries-when the church focused on orthodoxy and right beliefs.</p><p> The Age of the Spirit, that began in the 1960s and is shaping not just Christianity but other religious traditions today, is ignoring dogma and breaking down barriers between different religions. Spirituality is replacing formal religion. </p><p> Reflecting on how his own faith journey mirrors these three historical shifts, Cox personalizes the material in a compelling, practical ways. The Future of Faith is a major statement by one of the most revered theologians today.</p><p>Harvey Cox is the Hollis Research Professor of Divinity at Harvard University, where he has taught since 1965, both at Harvard Divinity School and in the Harvard Fac- ulty of Arts and Sciences.

Whipped into a frenzy, they&#x2019;ll never stop coming for her. And only the taste of one Carpathian warrior&#x2014;the rush of his blood&#x2014;can save her...</p><p><b>Christine Feehan</b> is the #1<i> New York Times </i>bestselling author of the Carpathian series (<i>Dark Carousel</i>, <i>Dark Promises</i>), the GhostWalker series (<i>Power Game</i>, <i>Spider Game</i>), the Leopard series (<i>Leopard&#x2019;s Fury</i>,<i> Wild Cat</i>), the Sea Haven series (<i>Bound Together, Fire Bound</i>) and the Shadow series (<i>Shadow Reaper</i>, <i>Shadow Rider</i>).1<br><br> Emeline Sanchez watched the children playing in the large play yard directly across from her little Victorian home. She liked sitting outside on the wide, wraparound porch where the wind could touch her face. Sometimes, that small touch was the only relief she got from the relentless pain winding through her body every minute of the night and day.<br><br> Rain had given the air a clean, fresh scent. The world looked shiny and new, every leaf on the trees a vivid green or silver. Small birds sang to one another, hopping from tree branches to gnarled limbs. They were bright red spots of color, adding to the beauty of the compound. The property was owned by Tariq Asenguard, co-owner of a string of high-end nightclubs. He had a unique piece of property, and she would have loved to live there if things had been different. Tariq was Carpathian, an ancient race with amazing gifts, but they needed to drink blood to survive. She knew they were forced to sleep in the ground during daylight hours and only came out at night. If they didn't find their lifemate in time, many succumbed to the temptation to feel by becoming the vilest of creatures-vampire.<br><br> "Emeline." A tall woman with long, dark hair and forest green eyes waved at her from the play yard. "It's a beautiful day."<br><br> Genevieve Marten was gorgeous. Model thin. Tall with long legs that went on forever. Dressed in slim jeans and leather boots, she looked far too elegant, even in that attire, to be playing nanny to five children. Emeline knew Genevieve was independently wealthy and had traveled the world, yet she was as sweet as anyone could be, and she'd taken on the job of looking after the children when Tariq and Charlotte couldn't. Emeline was certain Genevieve didn't have a mean bone in her body.<br><br> "It is, isn't it?" she called back. For that one moment, Emeline felt normal, like she had a friend and they shared a joyous moment just because it was such a beautiful day.<br><br> As she waved, a long tangle of blue-black hair fell around her face and she pushed it back, vaguely thinking she was going to have to cut it soon. She'd always loved her hair, the one feature she thought was attractive about her. But it fell below her waist, and she was just too exhausted to take proper care of it. Merely lifting her arms to brush it, much less wash it, was becoming a terrible chore. She sighed and rested her chin on the heel of her hand, her eyes on the five children running.<br><br> She loved watching the children. She didn't really know true happiness anymore, but the closest she came was at times like this, observing them playing and laughing, seemingly carefree and happy. They were alive because of her deliberate sacrifice. The sound of their laughter, seeing them on swings and slides and doing normal things, was worth every horrific moment she'd suffered. They were alive. Traumatized, yes, but still alive and hopefully recovering very quickly.<br><br> "Come join us," Genevieve called.<br><br> Emeline wanted to join them. She even needed to, but she couldn't take the chance. She didn't think Genevieve would turn on her, but there were others . . .<br><br> "I'm drinking tea," she said. "You should join me. I baked cookies."<br><br> The children had become aware she was out on her porch, something she often did during the daylight hours, even in the middle of a violent storm, but never at night. At night, she stayed in the house, her heart beating too hard, terrified he would come for her. She knew Vadim was coming, it was only a matter of time. He whispered to her sometimes, when she wasn't strong enough to keep him out of her head. Those times were becoming more and more frequent. Emeline often had prophetic dreams. She could replay them over and over, changing small details in an effort to change the outcome of what occurred. Vadim had found her in those dreams, he had found a way to trap her and capture her. She escaped, but he was still with her in her mind now, impossible to get out.<br><br> "Emeline!" the chorus of voices called to her. Happy. Affectionate. Although she rarely left her porch, they knew she had their backs. She'd saved them more than once at a great cost to herself. They weren't fully aware of that expense, and she hoped they never would be. They were too young to bear any more burdens than they already did.<br><br> "Swing with us, Em," Danny called. At fifteen, he was tall and gangly, his form just beginning to show the promise of who he would become. Emeline knew he had great courage, as well as love for his siblings. He'd kept them together after their parents had died, and when the girls were taken by the monstrous men down in the labyrinth beneath the city, he had gone after them. She couldn't help but admire Danny.<br><br> "Not right now, but I have a plate full of warm chocolate chip cookies. And, Genevieve, I also have fresh cranberry and pistachio biscotti dipped in white chocolate."<br><br> Tariq Asenguard had taken the children in, become a foster parent of sorts, until the adoptions came through, protecting them with his friends and unique security system-just as he protected her. Emeline was grateful to him, but she knew she couldn't stay much longer.<br><br> Danny raced to the porch, leaned down and brushed the top of her head with a kiss, scooped up a handful of cookies and was back at the swings before either three-year-old, Lourdes or Bella, could protest. Bella was his youngest sister. Lourdes was the orphaned niece of Tariq's wife, Charlotte.<br><br> "Thanks, Em!" Danny yelled, stuffing one into his mouth whole. "So good." Both little girls immediately held out their hand for one, and Danny obliged them.<br><br> Despite his youth, Danny watched over his family with a fierce protectiveness. He was equally as protective of little Lourdes, Emeline, and Emeline's best friend, Blaze. They'd helped him when he thought everything was lost. He was a smart boy, indescribably brave, and he'd begun to emulate the Carpathian males who'd taken them all in. His hair was a little too long, because he was growing it so he could pull it back in a long ponytail like the Carpathian males often wore. He admired Tariq and even walked like him.<br><br> They'd been orphans living on the streets, trying to stay together, when the girls had been taken. Danny had refused to give up on his sisters and had gone after them, down into the underbelly of the city-a huge labyrinth of tunnels and rooms, a city below the city. Emeline shivered at the memory. She tried very hard not to think about it, to close the door on the horrors of what had been down there. She first encountered Danny in a dream and then, later, in reality when his sisters had been taken. Despite knowing what would happen to her, she had aided him in ensuring the safety of the girls. She'd seen her fate enough times in dreams, but someone had to get the children out or they would have died in that murky, stench-filled place of nightmares.<br><br> She understood street children; she'd been one herself and she knew how much they craved the stability of a close family. She looked around the huge complex, with the buildings, gardens and lake bordering one side, the high fence surrounding the property on the other three sides, and all the amenities the acreage offered. It was still a prison. No matter how beautiful, none of them could safely leave. Not even the children. Maybe especially the children.<br><br> "Cranberry and pistachio biscotti?" Genevieve put her book down. She'd gone to the bench under the tall oak where she could keep an eye on the children. "You made them?"<br><br> "This morning," Emeline enticed. She wanted Genevieve's company. She needed to feel normal even if it was just for a few minutes. Sometimes, if her focus changed, she could resist the pain longer, not be afraid for just a few minutes and pretend that she would have a life like everyone else. She needed that today-one of the reasons she'd spent all morning baking.<br><br> "You can ride my dragon," Amelia offered. She was fourteen, her body already developing into that of a woman's. Her hair was thick and often tousled from her continual roughhousing with her brother. She had beautiful eyes and a killer smile. Emeline adored her and the way she loved her sisters and brother.<br><br> Emeline knew it was huge to get an offer to ride one of the dragons. Made of stone, the five dragons-each with a unique color-sat off to one side of the play yard. They looked as if they were statues, just that. Nothing else. Emeline knew that each dragon had been made specifically for one of the children. For their amusement, yes, but mostly for protection. The dragons, crouched so lifelike in the massive yard, could suddenly come to life, spread wings and fly as well as breathe fire. Amelia's dragon was a striking orange and she loved it dearly. Emeline often saw her whispering to it, or circling the long neck with her arm and nuzzling it with affection.<br><br> Emeline sighed. She detested disappointing the children, especially Amelia or Liv, the ten-year-old, but she didn't dare chance leaving the porch.<br><br> "I'd love to ride your dragon, Amelia. He's beautiful, but I'm enjoying just sitting here, drinking tea and watching all of you." That was strictly the truth. "Come get some cookies. I don't know if dragons like them, but you can feed him one and tell him it's from me."<br><br> Amelia giggled and crossed the yard to the house at a much more demure pace than her brother. The Victorian was a smaller replica of the much larger one that was Tariq and Charlotte's home. That house loomed in the background, just beyond the play yard. Emeline always enjoyed looking at it as well. Tariq's main home was a sprawling mansion with the classic semicircular arches, corbel gables, rock-faced square towers, archivolt and transom windows in a ribbon pattern, all classic Richardsonian Romanesque.<br><br> Water from the lake lapped lazily at the shore. The sun poured down into it, so that droplets disturbed by fish and birds appeared as dazzling diamonds dripping into the water, causing beautiful rings that spread across the surface. Emeline always found peace in the sound of the water moving. Sometimes she wished she was like Blaze or Charlotte, no longer human but Carpathian, the ancient race of people capable of amazing things. With a wave of their hands they could move water, make it dance, keep that soothing sound up so she could concentrate on it rather than the pain racking her body.<br><br> Amelia threw herself into the chair across from Emeline's. She caught up a cookie and leaned forward. "Em, you do know if there's anything at all I could do for you, I'd do it."<br><br> God. She loved the children. They were all so amazing. Every last one of them. She was grateful she'd made the decision to go into that labyrinth, the chambers of utter horror, to get them out. She refused to regret that decision, no matter the price she had to pay-and she was paying it every single minute of the day. She forced a reassuring smile. "I know I look awful, Amelia, but I'm getting better." That was a lie. The pain was getting worse. Pain and fear. She kept a close eye on the sky. Sunset was fast approaching and she'd go immediately into the house once the sun dropped out of the sky.<br><br> "No, you're not," Amelia whispered. "You're not, Emeline. Please let Tariq or one of the others help you. A couple of the scariest ones are good healers."<br><br> Emeline couldn't help the automatic withdrawal, the way her body went smaller. She wrapped her arms around herself, as if she could cloak her body, make herself invisible. The ancient race could heal. She'd seen it. She wanted to be able to go to them and ask for help. Anything at all to stop the pain. She shook her head. "I'm fine. I don't need them."<br><br> "Are you afraid of them? I'd go with you."<br><br> Amelia reached out and touched her wrist and followed the line of bruising up to her elbow. Her touch was light, but it still hurt. Emeline forced herself to remain still. Amelia had been traumatized by the events in the underground city. She didn't need to worry about Emeline when there was nothing she could do. Emeline wanted her to be a child, although, realistically, she knew there was no going back for Amelia.<br><br> "It's such a beautiful day, isn't it? I love the rain, but this is gorgeous, everything fresh and shimmering new." She kept her voice light as she casually reached for her teacup, the action giving her a legitimate reason for moving her arm out of reach. When she settled the teacup back into its saucer, she put her hand in her lap, surreptitiously tugging on the sleeve to cover the bruising.<br><br> Amelia opened her mouth as if she might say something, but in the end, she just took a bite of the cookie. "These are still warm."<br><br> "Right? They're so good. I love them with ice cream."<br><br> Amelia scooped up three more. "My dragon's going to love these just like they are. Thanks. Any time you want a ride, let me know, and if you need me, Em, I'll come stay with you." Her gaze dropped to Emeline's bruised arm, not that she could see the discoloration, but she knew it was there.<br><br> "Thanks, honey," Emeline said, fighting the burn of tears. "Go have fun with your dragon."<br><br> Amelia hesitated, standing awkwardly in front of her, then she leaned down and brushed a kiss across her forehead. "You're important, too, Em. To all of us. You know that, don't you?"<br><br> Emeline tightened her arms around her middle, holding it together by a mere thread. She was going to have to risk leaving the compound to ensure Amelia's-and the other children's-safety. She knew when she made the decision to leave that she probably wouldn't survive. "Thank you, Amelia. Sometimes, I guess, we all need a reminder."<br><br> She wasn't as important as the children. They deserved a life, and they'd never had it. They were street children, living from one garbage can to another, the older ones stealing to provide for the younger ones. Huddling together to keep warm in the worst of winter. Here, in Tariq Asenguard's compound with the wealthy Carpathian as their guardian, she knew they finally had a home. She couldn't endanger them by drawing the worst evil imaginable to them.</p><h2>Halo Evolutions: Essential Tales of the Halo Universe: 1</h2><p>The original Halo: Evolutions, split into two volumes.&nbsp; This volume contains stories by: Tobias S.

The thing she was waiting for was called <i>Twofire</i>, an optical effect caused by the light from two suns passing under the horizon and reflecting on scattered clouds above. It was beautiful, and she was trying to capture it in real time, spraying smart-pigments onto a glass surface from her color-sensing jetbrush. From her position on the hill above Wharftown, she had a perfect view of the azure expanse of sea, with distant whitecaps beyond the reef now picking up motes of pink. She ignored the bucolic bustle of the town below and concentrated. She had moved here for these moments; silence, unsterilized air, sounds of nature, the minuscule dangers of a real place--stinging plants and quarrelsome insects. Like the inhabitants of the town below, Soma had given up her armor in order to experience life more intimately. No more lenses, no more n-barriers, no more omniscient guides. She had come here seeking a primitivelifestyle, one demonstrated perfectly in her sagging skin, her telling wrinkles. She'd come here to love life, but also to age and to die. At 417 years of age, Soma was young to be taking this path, but hardly unique. Wharftown was filled with her peers, and more besides, scattered thinly, perhaps a million souls planted here on the massive planet Seaward, unromantically called G617 g1 by outsiders adrift on endless ocean, just as the world itself was adrift in endless space, hanging on a lonely binary system at the galaxy's trailing edge. This was the last stop before intergalactic space and lifeless void. A fitting waiting room for death's cool arms. And the citizens of Seaward were all, as their society measured it, wealthy. The world itself was a secret, publicly and officially a lifeless ball of dirt, a place truly worth ignoring. Those who could afford it had found a private, expensive sanctuary from society, and great power and influence had been poured into purchasing anonymity for this beautiful, verdant world. Wharftown sat on a rocky shard of volcanic surge, a thousand miles from the equator. There was little there but dwellings, parks, and one of the few significant stretches of arable land, most of it terraced in pretty defiance of the towering hummocks and fangs of basalt. Here on Seaward, contact with society proper was limited. Communications were almost nonexistent. Supplies sometimes came silently by transorbital balloon, jettisoned by unseen starships, inflating at the bottom edge of the stratosphere, then drifting gracefully to land their cargoes. They seldom came with messages or instructionsor scolding. Instead they simply brought gifts, food, technology, and repairs. Seaward was tolerated, encouraged even, by distant, benevolent friends who asked for nothing in return but the trades of energy and art that financed its existence. Soma's hand hovered above the glass, the delicate steely wand of the jetbrush held confidently between stained fingers. Her creased, sun-worn brow wrinkled further, its bluish fur furrowing as as she stared dutifully at the horizon and squinted to keep the brightness out of her rheumy eyes. The jetbrush winked its ready state, absorbing light, tiny whirling motors ready for painting. As the two suns moved lower, their proximity to each other increased, and momentarily, both seemed to shine more fiercely. And, as if acting on some unheard order, the clouds responded, their pink gossamer suddenly finding vermillion flame, then green, then blue. A flitting rainbow of hot color, then just as quickly fading back to pink. Soma blinked tears back, resisted the photic urge to sneeze, wiped her eyes with a small silk handkerchief, and looked at the glass in front of her. Sure enough. Some of the colors were there, strewn not quite accurately on the skyscape she'd prepared. <i>Wonderful</i>, she thought to herself. She examined the pattern and then frowned. The jetbrush had also laid down a flaw with its capture of that momentary light. A dark gray streak. A dirty charcoal imperfection drawn through the center of the other hues in a floundering arc, trailing a sickly yellow smoke behind it. Disturbed, she glanced back at the sky itself. Theimperfection from her painting hung there in the pink sky. Real. Baleful. Moving steadily and purposefully to the horizon. Something was coming. Something was wrong. Soma the Painter folded her glass easel, hurriedly packed her things, and began the long climb down to Wharftown.

Though she has no hard evidence against the man, Sarah has been assaulted and received death threats for her meddling. DeMarco, given his years of experience bending the rules in D.C., suspects that a middleman like himself is pulling strings for the tycoon.

Bodysnatching was rife. The 1832 Anatomy Act, however, appropriated instead the corpses of the poor, effectively rendering dissection a punishment for poverty. <i>Death, Dissection and the Destitute</i> reveals why fear of the pauper funeral so afflicted the nineteenth-century poor.

At the age of eight, she immigrated with her family to Canada. Her mother was a tailor by trade and took in alterations as a way to stay home with her children. Katja grew up under her mother's sewing machine, and spent many childhood hours crafting, sewing, crocheting, and cross-stitching. Unlike most teenage girls, Katja spent her money not on makeup and music, but on fabric. When she was 14, the family moved to a camp/resort, where many of the cabin beds featured handmade quilts. Katja fell in love with an old version of a Grandmother's Fan design. Without any knowledge of quilting, but with a vast knowledge of sewing, she proceeded to make templates and cut pieces from old clothing--and thus her quilting journey began. Winning the award for art achievement in high school convinced her that she wanted to pursue a career with a creative outlet. In 1999, with years of banking behind her and her children in their teens, the time had come for Katja to realize that dream. She fulfilled her vision by opening her own quilt shop in Kamloops, British Columbia.

Mary Ann Esposito has 10 seasons of cooking on public television and 5 cookbooks to her name, and she still manages to offer 130 new recipes presented in a culinary tour so captivating, you'll read this cover to cover.<p> The chapters are divided by region, and each begins with a mouthwatering tour followed by recipes that begin with stories--sometimes historical, sometimes personal, sometimes just delectable descriptions. From Tuscany you might make White Beans with Fettuccine and Sage because it sounds so delicious; from Sicily you'll make Swordfish with Spaghetti, Tomato Sauce, and Olives because the thought of enjoying it in a Sicilian seaside community near Palermo makes you sigh; and from Emilia Romagna you'll choose Beatrice's Fried Mushrooms because everything Beatrice makes is "exquisite." Packed with information, this is a perfect book for a novice cook who needs plenty of detail, but it's also a gem for the more experienced chef because so many of Esposito's recipes are region-specific, and therefore uncommon. Esposito shares a wealth of information about the Italian people, their culture and their cooking, and the result is that many of her recipes are interesting and unusual, such as Gorgonzola Cheese with Marmalade, Fried Sage Leaves, or Whipped Cod Venetian Style--all easy to master, impressive to serve, and absolutely divine.

How and why did it begin? Will it come to an end, and if so, how? Hawking attempts to reveal these questions (and where we're looking for answers) using a minimum of technical jargon. Among the topics gracefully covered are gravity, black holes, the Big Bang, the nature of time, and physicists' search for a grand unifying theory. This is <i>deep</i> science; these concepts are so vast (or so tiny) as to cause vertigo while reading, and one can't help but marvel at Hawking's ability to synthesize this difficult subject for people not used to thinking about things like alternate dimensions. The journey is certainly worth taking, for, as Hawking says, the reward of understanding the universe may be a glimpse of "the mind of God." <i>--Therese Littleton</i>"A Brief History of Time, published in 1988, was a landmark volume in science writing and in world-wide acclaim and popularity, with more than 9 million copies in print globally. The original edition was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the origins and nature of the universe. But the ensuing years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic world--observations that have confirmed many of Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book. <br>Now a decade later, this edition updates the chapters throughout to document those advances, and also includes an entirely new chapter on Wormholes and Time Travel and a new introduction.

The historical record is unclear on whether Champlain was baptized Protestant or Catholic, but he fought in France's religious wars for the man who would become Henri IV, one of France's greatest kings, and like Henri, he was religiously tolerant in an age of murderous sectarianism. Champlain was also a brilliant navigator. He went to sea as a boy and over time acquired the skills that allowed him to make twenty-seven Atlantic crossings without losing a ship.<br> <br>But we remember Champlain mainly as a great explorer. On foot and by ship and canoe, he traveled through what are now six Canadian provinces and five American states. Over more than thirty years he founded, colonized, and administered French settlements in North America. Sailing frequently between France and Canada, he maneuvered through court intrigue in Paris and negotiated among more than a dozen Indian nations in North America to establish New France. Champlain had early support from Henri IV and later Louis XIII, but the Queen Regent Marie de Medici and Cardinal Richelieu opposed his efforts. Despite much resistance and many defeats, Champlain, by his astonishing dedication and stamina, finally established France's New World colony. He tried constantly to maintain peace among Indian nations that were sometimes at war with one another, but when he had to, he took up arms and forcefully imposed a new balance of power, proving himself a formidable strategist and warrior.<br> <br>Throughout his three decades in North America, Champlain remained committed to a remarkable vision, a Grand Design for France's colony. He encouraged intermarriage among the French colonists and the natives, and he insisted on tolerance for Protestants. He was a visionary leader, especially when compared to his English and Spanish contemporaries&#x2014;a man who dreamed of humanity and peace in a world of cruelty and violence.<br> <br>This superb biography, the first in decades, is as dramatic and exciting as the life it portrays. Deeply researched, it is illustrated throughout with many contemporary images and maps, including several drawn by Champlain himself.</p><p><b>David Hackett Fischer</b> is University Professor and Warren Professor of History at Brandeis University in Massachusetts. The recipient of many prizes and awards for his teaching and writing, he is the author of numerous books, including <i>Washington's Crossing</i>, which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in history.<b>Introduction</b><p><i>In Search of Champlain</i></p><p>His activities, which were revealed mainly through his writings, were always surrounded by a certain degree of mystery. -- Raymonde Litalien, 2004</p><p>An old French engraving survives from the early seventeenth century. It is a battle-print, at first glance like many others in European print shops. We look again, and discover that it shows a battle in North America, fought between Indian nations four centuries ago. The caption reads in old French, "Deffaite des Yroquois au Lac de Champlain," the "Defeat of the Iroquois at Lake Champlain," July 30, 1609.</p><p>On one side we see sixty Huron, Algonquin, and Montagnais warriors. On the other are two hundred Iroquois of the Mohawk nation. They meet in an open field beside the lake. The smaller force is attacking boldly, though outnumbered three to one. The Mohawk have sallied from a log fort to meet them. By reputation they are among the most formidable warriors in North America. They have the advantage of numbers and position, and yet the caption tells us that the smaller force won the fight.3</p><p>The print offers an explanation in the presence of a small figure who stands alone at the center of the battle. His dress reveals that he is a French soldier and a man of rank. He wears half-armor of high quality: a well-fitted cuirass on his upper body, and protective britches of the latest design with light steel plates on his thighs.4 His helmet is no ordinary <i>morion</i>, or crude iron pot of the kind that we associate with Spanish conquistadors and English colonists. It is an elegant example of what the French call a <i>casque bourgignon</i>, a Burgundian helmet of distinctive design that was the choice of kings and noblemen -- a handsome, high-crowned helmet with a comb and helm forged from a single piece of metal.5 Above the helmet is a large plume of white feathers called a <i>panache</i> -- the origin of our modern word. Its color identifies the wearer as a captain in the service of Henri IV, first Bourbon king of France. Its size marks it as a badge of courage worn to make its wearer visible in battle.6</p><p>This French captain is not a big man. Even with his panache, the Indians appear half a head taller. But he has a striking presence, and in the middle of a wild mï¿½lï¿½e he stands still and quiet, firmly in command of himself. His back is straight as a ramrod. His muscular legs are splayed apart and firmly planted to bear the weight of a weapon which he holds at full length. It is not a conventional matchlock, as historians have written, but a complex and very costly <i>arquebuse ï¿½ rouet</i>, a wheel-lock arquebus. It was the first self-igniting shoulder weapon that did not require a burning match, and could fire as many as four balls in a single shot.7</p><p>The text with this engraving tells us that the French captain has already fired his arquebus and brought down two Mohawk chiefs and a third warrior, who lie on the ground before him. He aims his weapon at a fourth Mohawk, and we see the captain fire again in a cloud of white smoke. On the far side of the battlefield, half-hidden in the American forest, two French <i>arquebusiers</i> emerge from the trees. They kneel and fire their weapons into the flank of the dense Iroquois formation.8</p><p>We look back at the French captain and catch a glimpse of his face. He has a high forehead, arched brows, eyes set wide apart, a straight nose turned up at the tip, a fashionable mustache, and a beard trimmed like that of his king, Henri IV . The key below the print gives us his name, the "sieur de Champlain."</p><p>This small image is the only authentic likeness of Samuel de Champlain that is known to survive from his own time. It is also a self-portrait, and its technique tells us other things about the man who drew it. A French scholar observes that "its style is that of a man of action, direct, natural, naive, biased toward exact description, toward the concrete and the useful." This is art without a hint of artifice. It tells a story in a straightforward way. At the same time, it expresses the artist's pride in his acts, and confidence in his purposes. It also points up a paradox in what we know about him. It describes his actions in detail, but the man himself is covered in armor, and his face is partly hidden by his own hand.10</p><p>Other images of Champlain would be invented after the fact. Many years later, when he was recognized as the father of New France, he was thought to require a proper portrait. Artists and sculptors were quick to supply a growing market. Few faces in modern history have been reinvented so often and from so little evidence. All these images are fictions. The most widely reproduced was a fraud, detected many years ago and still used more frequently than any other.11</p><p>Historians also contributed many word-portraits of Champlain, and no two are alike. His biographer Morris Bishop asserted from little evidence that "Champlain was, in fact, a lean ascetic type, dry and dark, probably rather under than over normal size...his southern origin is indication enough of dark hair and black eyes."12 Another biographer, Samuel Eliot Morison, wrote from no evidence whatever: "As one who has lived with Champlain for many years, I may be permitted to give my own idea of him. A well-built man of medium stature, blond and bearded, a natural leader who inspired loyalty and commanded obedience."13 A third author, Heather Hudak, represented him with bright red hair, a black panache and chartreuse britches.14 Playwright Michael Hollingsworth described Champlain as prematurely gray, as well he might have been, and an anonymous engraver gave him snow-white hair. Champlain's biographies, like his portraits, show the same wealth of invention and poverty of fact.15</p><p>Champlain himself was largely responsible for that. He wrote thousands of pages about what he did, but only a few words about who he was. His published works are extraordinary for an extreme reticence about his origins, inner thoughts, private life, and personal feelings. Rarely has an author written so much and revealed so little about himself. These were not casual omissions, but studied silences. Here again, as in the old battle-print, Champlain was hidden by his own hand. He was silent and even secretive about the most fundamental facts of his life. He never mentioned his age. His birth date is uncertain. Little information survives about his family, and not a word about his schooling. He was raised in an age of faith, but we do not know if he was baptized Protestant or Catholic.</p><p>After all this uncertainty about the man himself, it is a relief to turn to the record of his acts. Here we have an abundance of evidence, and it makes a drama that is unique in the history of exploration. No other discoverer mastered so many roles over so long a time, and each of them presents a puzzle.</p><p>By profession Champlain was a soldier, and he chose to represent himself that way in his self-portrait. He fought in Europe, the Caribbean, and North America, bore the scars of wounds on his face and body, and witnessed atrocities beyond imagining. Like many old soldiers, he took pride in his military service, but he grew weary of war. Always he kept a soldier's creed of honor, courage, and duty, but increasingly did so in the cause of peace. There is a question about how he squared these thoughts.</p><p>At the same time, Champlain was a mariner of long experience. He went to sea at an early age, and rose from ship's boy to "admirall" of a colonizing fleet. From 1599 to 1633 he made at least twenty-seven Atlantic crossings and hundreds of other voyages. He never lost a ship under his command, except once when he was a passenger aboard a sinking barque in a heavy gale on a lee shore, with a captain who was unable to act. Champlain seized command, set the mainsail, and deliberately drove her high on a rocky coast in a raging storm -- and saved every man aboard. There are interesting questions to be asked about his leadership and astonishing seamanship.16</p><p>Champlain is best remembered for his role as an explorer. He developed a method of close-in coastal exploration that he called "ferreting," and he used it to study thousands of miles of the American coast from Panama to Labrador. He also explored much of North America through what are now six Canadian provinces and five American states. He was the first European to see much of this countryside, and he enabled us to see it through his eyes. His unique methods raise another question about how he did that work, and with what result.</p><p>Champlain also mapped this vast area in yet another role as a cartographer. He put himself in the forefront of geographic knowledge in his era. His many maps and charts set a new standard for accuracy and detail. Experts have studied them with amazement. They wonder how he made maps of such excellence with the crude instruments at his command.17 He also embellished his maps with handsome drawings. In his own time he was known as an artist. When rival French merchants opposed his appointment to high office, they complained that Champlain was a "mere painter," and therefore unfit for command. In his drawings he left us a visual record of the new world, which alone would make him an important figure. To study the few originals is to discover the skill and refinement of his art. But nearly all his art survives only in crude copies that challenge us to recover the spirit of his work.18</p><p>Champlain was a prolific writer. He is most accessible to us through his published books, which exceed in quantity and quality the work of every major explorer of North America during his era. A close second was the work of Captain John Smith, but Champlain's published writings were larger in bulk. They covered a broader area, spanned a longer period, and drew deeply on the intellectual currents of his age. The problem is to find the mind behind the prose.</p><p>In his books Champlain played a role as a pioneer ethnographer. He left an abundance of first-hand description about many Indian nations in North America. During the late twentieth century some scholars criticized him for ...</p></p><h2>Unleash the Night (A Dark-Hunter Novel, Book 9)</h2><p>unleash the forbidden,unleash the hunger....in this ninth installment of the wonderful dark hunters,ms.kenyon just keeps getting better!this is the unique and poignant story of wren tigarian[were-animal]and marguerite d&#39;aubert goudeau.</p><p></p><h2>Japanese Homes and Their Surroundings</h2><p>Describes and illustrates the construction methods, materials, styles and designs of traditional domestic architecture in Japan</p><p>More than three hundred detailed illustrations by the author provide accurate information on types of houses, interiors of both ordinary and teahouse rooms, floor plans, roof detailing, methods of structure and construction, gardens, decorations, tools, furniture, and fittings.<b>Edward S.

If, unlike their counterparts in physics, biologists are generally wary of a grand, overarching theory, at what kinds of explanation do biologists aim? How will we know when we have "made sense" of life? Such questions, Evelyn Fox Keller suggests, offer no simple answers. Explanations in the biological sciences are typically provisional and partial, judged by criteria as heterogeneous as their subject matter. It is Keller's aim in this bold and challenging book to account for this epistemological diversity--particularly in the discipline of developmental biology. </p><p> In particular, Keller asks, what counts as an "explanation" of biological development in individual organisms? Her inquiry ranges from physical and mathematical models to more familiar explanatory metaphors to the dramatic contributions of recent technological developments, especially in imaging, recombinant DNA, and computer modeling and simulations. </p><p> A history of the diverse and changing nature of biological explanation in a particularly charged field, <i>Making Sense of Life</i> draws our attention to the temporal, disciplinary, and cultural components of what biologists mean, and what they understand, when they propose to explain life. </p></p><p><b>Evelyn Fox Keller</b> is Professor of History and Philosophy of Science at MIT.

After a brief and harrowing period among men, he turned back to the African jungle where he had grown to manhood. It was there he first heard of Opar, the city of gold, left over from fabled Atlantis.<br>It was a city of hideous men -- and of beautiful, savage women, over whom reigned La, high priestess of the Flaming God. Its altars were stained with the blood of many sacrifices. Unheeding of the dangers, Tarzan led a band of savage warriors toward the ancient crypts and the more ancient evil of Opar . . .</p><p>The first time I ever went to Tarzana, California, I walked down Ventura Boulevard, noticing that all of the buildings were really ugly. Then I arrive at my destination: a small house, set back from the street, with a beautiful tree shading the entire front yard. Inside, the air was cool and everything was polished wood, especially the incredible, gigantic desk. That's where he worked. It was awesome.<br><br>Edgar Rice Burroughs had a huge California ranch, and the land eventually became a town, named for Burroughs's most famous character. Burroughs created one of the few heroes everyone knows, and at that desk, he took Tarzan to exotic lands, had him face bizarre creatures and endless, exotic challenges. Those adventures spirit the reader away to a timeless time of action and heroism. And sitting in that office, I was a permanent convert. For me, and for countless others, the legend will never cease.

Soon Ruby is singing the blues and taking her school auditorium by storm. Daly tells a simple story of a child learning to focus and develop her talents. The nicely paced, rhythmic text will read well to a crowd, and the lyrical descriptions of what Ruby learns to do ("sing sharp, zooming notes like the sounds of the city . . and gentle breathy notes like a cool evening breeze") will introduce children to the musicianship and emotion singers bring to their work. Daly's mixed-media illustrations showcase a cast of urban hipsters wearing patterned outfits that extend the rhythms in the story, and present raucous scenes of folks in Ruby's multicultural neighborhood grooving to tunes that celebrate music's power to bring people together. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

In <em>Lincoln</em>, acclaimed biographer Fred Kaplan explores the life of America's sixteenth president through his use of language as a vehicle both to express complex ideas and feelings and as an instrument of persuasion and empowerment. Like the other great canonical writers of American literature&#x2014;a status he is gradually attaining&#x2014;Lincoln had a literary career that is inseparable from his life story. An admirer and avid reader of Burns, Byron, Shakespeare, and the Old Testament, Lincoln was the most literary of our presidents. His views on love, liberty, and human nature were shaped by his reading and knowledge of literature.</p><p>Since Lincoln, no president has written his own words and addressed his audience with equal and enduring effectiveness. Kaplan focuses on the elements that shaped Lincoln's mental and imaginative world; how his writings molded his identity, relationships, and career; and how they simultaneously generated both the distinctive political figure he became and the public discourse of the nation. This unique account of Lincoln's life and career highlights the shortcomings of the modern presidency, reminding us, through Lincoln's legacy and appreciation for language, that the careful and honest use of words is a necessity for successful democracy.</p><p>Illuminating and engrossing, <em>Lincoln</em> brilliantly chronicles Abraham Lincoln's genius with language.</p><p>Fred Kaplan is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of English at Queens College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

She has been named a Grand Master of the World Horror Convention and a Living Legend by the International Horror Guild. She is well-known for her Saint Germain series, starting with <i>Hotel Transylvania</i>. Author of many novels of horror, dark fantasy, mystery, and more, Yarbro lives in Berkeley, California.<p>1</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>IT WAS one of those <i>probably nothing</i> noises, a sound that was part scrape, part yowl, a bit sneaky, and it brought Charis Treat abruptly awake, her pulse racing, words whispering out of her at machine-gun speed. &#x201c;It was a tree branch, or an angry cat, or something at the docks, or&#x2014;&#x201d; Or anything but the CIA bugging her Copenhagen hotel room. She sat up in bed, holding the pillow in front of her like a shield. Striving to separate herself from the fear that made her hands shake, she used her most reasonable lecture voice: &#x201c;You&#x2019;re in&#x2026;&#x201d; It took her a couple of seconds to remember. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re in Denmark, not Louisiana. You don&#x2019;t have to worry about the Committee, not here.&#x201d; Her voice was louder now, and she was breathing more normally. She forced herself to yawn, not very successfully, then she got up and went to the cramped bathroom, where she took a second phenobarbital and an aspirin, used the toilet, and went back to bed. Her alarm clock on the night-stand told her it was four-thirty-seven. &#x201c;Damn,&#x201d; she muttered. She would need to get back to sleep quickly if she were going to have sufficient rest when her breakfast tray arrived at six-forty-five. If only she did not have to be off for her interview by seven-thirty. She sighed and got slowly back into bed, ordering herself not to stare at the ceiling, trying to imagine what Harold and the kids were doing; that was something she would find out later. It would be a mistake, she thought, to go to her interview overcome by melancholy. &#x201c;Be sensible. They&#x2019;re fast asleep,&#x201d; she told herself aloud. &#x201c;Just as you should be, Charis.&#x201d; She often lectured herself sternly in the waning hours of the night, had done so since she was in grammar school. Now she leaned back and rested her head on the goose-down pillow, willing herself to sleep.</p> <p>After nearly an hour of watching the shadow-pattern of the birches&#x2019; falling leaves in the hotel garden dancing and sliding on the wall, she sighed, reached out, and turned on the bedside lamp; its yellow glow created a cone of light that allowed her to resume reading Paton&#x2019;s <i>Cry, the Beloved Country.</i> She managed to get through another twenty pages before the first signs of the advancing dawn suffused the room with thin, limpid light. Marking her page with a brass paper clip, she set the book down, turned off the light, and did her best to get at least enough of a doze to restore her to the semblance of alertness.</p> <p>&#x201c;Breakfast, Madame,&#x201d; said the waiter in acceptable English as he rapped twice on her door.</p> <p>&#x201c;Coming. Thank you,&#x201d; she said, dragging on her bathrobe as she got out of bed and into the chilly morning; she made her way to the door. &#x201c;Put it on the table,&#x201d; she said, thinking it was absurd to tell the young man that, since there was no other surface in the room that would reasonably accommodate the tray.</p> <p>The waiter offered her a neat little bow and set the tray down, and handed Charis the bill on a kind of clip-board.</p> <p>Charis went to pull her purse out from under the pillow, opened up her wallet, and removed four coins&#x2014;the same amount she had paid every breakfast for the last four mornings&#x2014;and went to close and lock her door as he left. &#x201c;Eggs, toast, herring, tea,&#x201d; she said as she lifted the lids on three plates, stacking them together on the remaining wedge of empty tabletop. The first day she had asked for orange juice as well, but was amazed at the cost, and had dropped it from her subsequent breakfasts. The eggs were soft-poached, just the way she liked them, and there was a little ramekin of fresh butter next to the two slices of toast. The herring was broiled. Not what she would have back home, but not too foreign, either. She fit the strainer on top of her cup and poured out the dark, leafy tea through the fine wire mesh, concentrating on not overfilling her cup, as she had done yesterday. There was so much to get used to! &#x201c;Book your call for six this evening,&#x201d; she reminded herself aloud as she pulled up the overstuffed chair from next to the bed and began to eat, keeping an eye on the clock.</p> <p>The noise that wakened her returned, and this time she realized it was the squeak of brakes on the delivery van that had just unloaded the day&#x2019;s produce at the hotel&#x2019;s kitchen door. She made herself chuckle at her fears, saying, &#x201c;Next you&#x2019;ll be jumping at phone calls.&#x201d;</p> <p>When she was finished with her meal, she went into the bathroom to wash and put herself in order. At thirty-six, she was still passably attractive, especially for an academic, she thought wryly, but she knew enough to be careful with her make-up and hair-style, to put the emphasis on her best features, which were her large, smoky-blue eyes and her teak-colored hair. She wished she had a shower, but made the most of a quick turn in the tub. The towel she had been provided was a pale blue, a bit threadbare, and scratchy. She rubbed herself down quickly and then took a minute to stare at herself in the mirror. She patted the dark smudges under her eyes and decided to use her Elizabeth Arden foundation&#x2014;it gave the best coverage. She took a moment to pluck a few stray hairs from her dark, angled brows, and sighed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to rely on charm, I guess. Looks aren&#x2019;t going to do it today.&#x201d; She applied her make-up with care, hoping to conceal the anxiety that had taken hold of her; it would be foolish to reveal how desperate her situation was becoming.</p> <p>She left her room a few minutes ahead of schedule, her fawn-colored wool jacket long and princess-cut over an ecru blouse an understated version of Dior&#x2019;s New Look. Her skirt was not quite the right length for sticklers, but its deep Prussian blue matched her gloves, her shoes, and her hat. Her purse was a simple dark-blue clutch&#x2014;shoulder bags had vanished from American stores when Hoover had declared that Communist sympathizers carried them&#x2014;and her briefcase was a darker version of her jacket. All in all, she was pleased with the impression she could make.</p> <p>The expression on the face of the clerk at the front desk confirmed her good opinion; he took her order for an eighteen-hundred-hours call to America, saying, &#x201c;Will you take it in your room or in the telephone lounge?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I think my room would be better, thank you,&#x201d; she said, wondering if she should tip him.</p> <p>He recognized her predicament. &#x201c;Gratuities are offered when the service is complete.&#x201d;</p> <p>She could feel her face grow warm. &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said again, and added, &#x201c;Your English is very good.&#x201d;</p> <p>The clerk smiled. &#x201c;My parents sent my brothers and me to our aunt in Canada during the war years.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Probably sensible,&#x201d; she said, missing her own sons, and turned toward the entrance. Stepping out of the hotel, she asked the doorman to hail a cab and gave the driver the address she had memorized the night before. &#x201c;I understand we should need about twenty minutes to thirty minutes, perhaps a little longer. The roads won&#x2019;t be crowded yet. In half an hour, they will be.&#x201d; He swooped into the street and lit a cigarette. &#x201c;I will have you there shortly after zero-eight-hundred. I know a shortcut.&#x201d; He grinned around the cigarette and signaled to turn left, making a rude gesture with his hand.</p> <p>The morning was nippy&#x2014;not quite cold, but chilly enough to make her think she had been wrong not to wear a coat. She settled back in the cab and watched the traffic around her, but gradually anticipation of the morning&#x2019;s meeting claimed her thoughts: she tried to decide what she would say to this Ragoczy Ferenz, Grof Szent-Germain; how should she address him? In what language? Did he speak English? French? She knew a little Italian, but not enough to discuss her book in it. She suspected he was Hungarian: the <i>sz</i> looked Hungarian, but it might be Polish or Czech. Probably not Russian: Russians weren&#x2019;t supposed to use titles like Grof any longer, unless he was one of the Old Regime, whose family fled before the Revolution. Certainly not Bulgarian or Croatian or Serbian or Montenegron, and probably not any other Jugoslavian ethnic group; for a while she mentally ran through the list of nationalities that Grof Szent-Germain might be but probably wasn&#x2019;t. She resisted the urge to bite the end of her little fingernail, telling herself it would smear her lipstick. The cab took an energetic turn to the left, and she grabbed the loop hanging down between the front and rear seats.</p> <p>&#x201c;Sorry; there was an obstacle in the road,&#x201d; said the driver, who was on his third cigarette.</p> <p>&#x201c;So I gather,&#x201d; said Charis, adjusting her hat and sitting back once more.</p> <p>The driver double-clutched down into second gear and climbed up a small rise; the street was very narrow, with ancient cobbles and the narrowest of walkways along the edge of the stones. The buildings here were old&#x2014;most a couple of centuries at least&#x2014;Charis realized, and wondered why a publishing house should be in this older part of the city. She was more startled when the driver turned into an even smaller side-street, barely wide enough for the cab to negotiate, and drew up in front of an elegant four-story building that looked to be about three hundred years old. &#x201c;Number 32, Madame,&#x201d; said the driver as he flipped up his trip-flag, and told her the price. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s zero-eight-hundred-twelve.&#x201d;</p> <p>She worked out the fare in American dollars: one-twenty-eight, more or less, yet another reminder of how the war had driven up the price of fuel and of operating a car. She handed over the appropriate coins, which still seemed dreadfully unfamiliar to her. &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said, letting herself out with care onto the narrow strip of brick sidewalk, her purse in one hand, her briefcase in the other; the cab was put into reverse and backed away from Charis&#x2019; destination.</p> <p>It was in beautiful repair, she thought as she climbed up to the front door, pausing to look at the various ornaments above the windows: most of it was scroll-work in a subdued Baroque style. Reaching the broad top step, she saw the modest bronze plaque above the knocker:</p> <p>ECLIPSE PUBLISHERS</p> <p>AND</p> <p>TRANSLATION SERVICES</p> <p>and above that was another one, saying, she assumed, the same thing in Danish.</p> <p>Charis hesitated, her confidence faltering, then remembered that Harold had not sent her the full hundred and fifty dollars he had promised her; she grabbed the knocker and swung it down on its strike plate twice and waited for someone to answer.</p> <p>Roughly a minute later, a man who looked to be about fifty, with sandy hair touched with white and eyes the color of old, much-washed blue jeans, opened the door. He nodded to Charis. &#x201c;Professor Treat?&#x201d; he asked in English; his accent was almost flawless.</p> <p>&#x201c;I am,&#x201d; she said, trying to conceal her sudden return of nervousness with a smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a little early, but I don&#x2019;t know the city and didn&#x2019;t want to be late.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Please come in; I&#x2019;m Rogers, the Grof&#x2019;s personal assistant,&#x201d; he said, stepping back and opening the door wider into a two-story entry hall with a single, broad staircase leading to the gallery circling the hexagonal room one floor up. He indicated a comfortable drawing room on Charis&#x2019; right. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;ll be seated, I&#x2019;ll tell the Grof that you&#x2019;ve arrived.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said, and glanced in at the muted blue-green walls and several large, oaken bookcases filled with hard-bound editions of all kinds, some looking to be almost as old as the building. Two sofas and a coffee-table stood in front of a handsome fireplace; the whole room was alight with watery sunshine.</p> <p>&#x201c;May I bring you some coffee or tea while you wait?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Will that be long?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Well, as you say, you are early, and the Grof is in a meeting.&#x201d;</p> <p>She hesitated, worried that her appointment might be cut short because of her early arrival, which might be seen as American pushiness; she knew Europeans disliked it. &#x201c;Coffee,&#x201d; she said when she realized that Rogers wanted an answer. &#x201c;With milk, no sugar.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Very good.&#x201d; He nodded again and left her to inspect the shelves, hoping to learn more about what Eclipse published.</p> <p>She had removed her gloves and was perusing a volume on the archeology of the Peruvian Andes, translated from the French; the date of publication was 1948, and the book was printed on coated stock with wonderful photographs, many in color. This was most encouraging, she decided, and turned around to find Rogers returned with a tray holding a large cup-and-saucer, a plunger coffee-maker, and a jug of milk. &#x201c;Oh. Good.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Shall I set it down, Professor Treat?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, please,&#x201d; she said, putting the book back on the shelf. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s quite fascinating, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Professor de Montalia&#x2019;s work? Yes, it is,&#x201d; Rogers agreed as he placed the tray on the coffee-table. &#x201c;The Grof will be with you shortly. He has been in a meeting with his printing staff, and they&#x2019;re going to run over&#x2014;something about the new presses. He apologizes for the delay.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Thank him for informing me,&#x201d; she said as she went to the nearer sofa and sat down, reaching for the small lacquer-work tray as she did.</p> <p>Rogers nodded toward the fireplace. &#x201c;Would you like me to light the kindling?&#x201d;</p> <p>The room was a little cool, and without a coat she was growing uncomfortable; she did not know how much longer she would be here, she reminded herself as she depressed the plunger on the coffee-pot. &#x201c;If it isn&#x2019;t inconvenient for you, that would be nice.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No inconvenience at all.&#x201d; Rogers went to a small, antique secretary and removed a box of fireplace matches, then moved the fire-screen and lit the kindling under the quartered logs. He remained where he was until he was satisfied that the logs were starting to burn. &#x201c;If you need anything more, please press the button by the door,&#x201d; he said, putting the fire-screen back in place, and going away.</p> <p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Charis called after him, then added milk to her coffee and tasted it, knowing it was still very hot. She set the cup down and rubbed her tongue on the roof of her mouth, feeling the first onset of interview-jitters take hold. Somewhere in the house, a clock sonorously rang the half-hour. It was the time appointed for her interview; in spite of all her good intentions, Charis began to fret. She drank her coffee and added more from the pot.</p> <p>Some five minutes later, she heard crisp footsteps approaching through the entry hall, and thinking this was Rogers coming to fetch her, she reached for her briefcase, preparing to rise.</p> <p>A moment later, a man of slightly less than average height, graceful yet sturdily built, came through the door. He appeared to be in his middle forties, had well-cut dark hair with a slight feathering of gray at the temples, and an angled arch to his brows; his face was more attractive than handsome, with a broad forehead and a slightly askew nose, his eyes an arresting, strange blue-black. He was dressed in a black suit of understated elegance. His shirt was off-white and obviously silk, as was his dark-red damask tie. His waistcoat had a subtle pattern of what looked like wings in its fine black wool. &#x201c;Professor Treat. Thank you for waiting,&#x201d; he said in English with a faint accent she was unable to identify. &#x201c;And I apologize for the early hour, but I will be leaving Copenhagen tomorrow and wanted to see you before I left, which is why I suggested an eight-thirty appointment.&#x201d; His voice was low and musical, and his manner, though formal, was welcoming.</p> <p>&#x201c;Grof Szent-Germain,&#x201d; she said, recovering herself, and, starting to rise, held out her hand, while struggling to get out of the deep sofa cushions.</p> <p>He came closer and took it, bowing slightly. &#x201c;A pleasure, Professor Treat. Welcome to Eclipse Publishing. I trust your journey was a pleasant one.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said, standing up a bit awkwardly. &#x201c;The cab-driver smoked a great deal.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;A...</p></p><h2>NBA Coaches Playbook: Techniques, Tactics, and Teaching Points</h2><p><p>The Phoenix Suns' Steve Nash shines in running the break, but how do his teammates know where to go to get open to receive his passes?

The book takes up the story of Molly as a widow, with very little money and three sons to educate. On the strength of her teaching experience, she becomes a schools inspector and examiner - a job which provides a rich source for anecdote. She moves her family to Cuffley, then an unspoilt rural village 15 miles from Kings Cross.

Vaccaro's story is unique: he was born in Pennsylvania, USA of Italian parents but spent most of his childhood under the fascist regime in Italy. He returned to the United States to finish high school, where he developed a passion for photography. Drafted into the army in 1944, Vaccaro was forced to return to Europe. He went armed with a gun and a camera. He came back, in 1949, with one of the most comprehensive photographic diaries by a serviceman in any war. <p>Vaccaro's relationship with photography was never casual. It was with great vigor that he studied photography during high school (the techniques he carefully memorized would later help him to mix chemicals on the battlefield and develop film in army helmets) and his early enthusiasm continued even when he was in danger of losing his life to Hitler's army. </p><p>This new book presents Vaccaro's most impressive images (including the famous "White Death" depicting a dead soldier nearly covered with snow), tracing his journey from the invasion in Normandy to the battles eastward past the Elbe river in Germany, through the aftermath of the war up until 1949. Vaccaro's fascinating autobiographical text, written specifically for this publication, gives important clues to his point of view as a photographer. His goal was to make a record of the war and the subsequent rebuilding of war-torn Germany so that future generations could see what it had been like, but his images are more than documentary photographs; they are a stunning visual diary of one man's experience of war and its disastrous effects.</p></p><p>Text: English, French, GermanAn eerie catalogue of the physical and spiritual cost of total war on conqueror and conquered alike. -- <i>Washington Post, May 28, 2001</i><br><br>Entering Germany is an engrossing document of artistic as well as social importance. -- <i>Associated Press, July 30, 2001</i><br><br>His pictures consistently reflect the humanity of his subjects, and reveal the fragile, precarious nature of former enemies learning to trust one another. -- <i>Bergen Record, May 16, 2001</i><br><br>In Tony Vaccaro&#x2019;s book we get a moving close-up of victory without the trumpets and flags. -- <i>Newsweek, June 25, 2001</i><br><br>It&#x2019;s a profound document of killing and victory, defeat and regret, and the German people&#x2019;s struggle towards normalcy after the fighting ended. -- <i>American Photo Magazine, July/August 2001</i><br><br>More than any corny movie or politically correct essay, the pictures in this book make the point that, national borders aside, we are all people. -- <i>Rockford Register Star, June 10, 2001</i></p><h2>The Door</h2><p>A young writer, struggling for success, employs an elderly woman called Emerence to be her housekeeper. From their first encounter it is clear that Emerence is no ordinary maid. Although everyone in the neighbourhood knows and respects her, no one knows anything about her private life or has ever crossed her threshold. Only a great drama in the writer&#39;s life prompts Emerence to unveil glimpses of her traumatic past - a past which sheds light on her peculiar behaviour. &#34;The Door&#34; brilliantly evokes the development of the bond between these two very different women, and the tragic ending to their relationship.</p><p>Magda Szabo was born in 1917 in Debrecen, Hungary.

It didn&#39;t matter that I was an alleged adult with children of my own. I just wasn&#39;t ready for my mother to die. Standing by her bed I became a small girl again, staring at the familiar shape of my mom&#39;s still hand, weeping and wanting only to hold it, warm once more. I did not know where the day of dread would lead. To my wonder, it opened the door to a flood of fresh grace. Riding it, I&#39;ve been upended, soaked, carried far downstream . . . and lifted, always lifted, by the buoyant gift of a grateful heart. That bequest, it seems, was my mother&#39;s parting surprise. I too had been a surprise. Mom had me at age forty-three, back in a time when middle-aged mothers weren&#39;t the norm. She had seriously spaced her children---I had siblings ten, twenty, and twenty-five years older. When I was little, my parents were my grandparents. At age ten I earnestly made my mom promise to live until she was eighty. That seemed impossibly far away, and Jesus would certainly return before then anyway. He didn&#39;t. But over the years, more than I realized, I learned about Him from the depth and breadth of my mother&#39;s bond. Her love was secure... not based on who I was or what I did, but on who she was. I thought of her today. Two birds wheeled in flight at the edge of the woods beyond our backyard. They were synchronized, wingtip to wingtip. Then one diverged and veered off sharply. I could not see where it went. The other continued alone. Then, unexpectedly, came the tears. Why? My mother lived a long, full life. Her death was neither premature nor unexpected. I&#39;m at peace with that. But peace and loss are not mutually exclusive. Despite the assurance that I&#39;ll see her again, I grieve. Her loss kaleidoscopes, multiplying through whatever prism I regard it. It telescopes, moving in and out like a zoom lens focusing on all the loss I feel. Past and future combine in the present: that diverging bird just now represents not only my mother and others who have gone before, but my husband, friends, children---all those I&#39;ll ever lose, one way or another. They&#39;ll drop suddenly from our bobbing flight, and I must continue alone. Mildred Miller was born in 1913 in her parents&#39; home in the valley of Virginia, one of nine durable children born in twelve years to John and Helen Miller. In spite of their perfectly respectable proper names, their dad called them Philip, Punker, Dutch, Puss, Cabbage, Jake, Beaner, Miss Moon, and Mouser. To hear my mom tell it---which may not be the way it happened--- she was an unusually gorgeous, intelligent, insightful, and whimsical child with short blond hair and hazel eyes. She walked on three miles of narrow dirt roads to school each day. Occasionally a car---one of those new Model T Fords---would pass Mildred and her sisters as they trudged along. When she was twelve, she and her sisters found smooth stones and dammed the creek on the back of their property. Three days later, when the resulting pool was deep and cold, the Church of the Brethren minister arrived and dunked them all. Mildred was baptized in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Over the years, her faith grew quietly, a steady flame within. She loved stories of brave missionaries bringing the Gospel to Gratitude&#39;s Surprises China or Vietnam or India or the Ivory Coast. She prayed faithfully and tithed from her grocery money to advance their cause. She taught Sunday school, met with young women whose marriages were troubled, made curtains, dresses, and quilts, and raised her family. Her own mother had been a domestically challenged adventurer. In spite of her nine children, she longed for the open road--- and often took it. Mom&#39;s response was to become a woman who created security wherever she was; her children&#39;s roots could grow deep and strong. Home was sun-warmed laundry fresh off the line and roast beef with rich gravy, marigolds and ripe tomatoes on the vine, new neighbors at the dinner table and furloughed missionaries sleeping in our spare beds. When I was young, she packed my lunch for school each day. Sometimes, wondering if I was paying attention to details, she would take a bite out of it. There I was, a big-eyed, dark-haired, unsuspecting child innocently unwrapping waxed paper in the elementary school lunchroom. I&#39;d find tuna salad or ham and cheese, stacked neatly on good white bread, pristine except for the halfmoon missing, Mom&#39;s dental surprise in an otherwise normal day. Once my sister got two pieces of bread with a chicken leg stuck between them, its tendoned knob emerging from between the crusts as if it had been trying to escape but couldn&#39;t. We grew up wary, on the lookout for eccentric sandwiches and odd visitations like stuffed animals perched on the hearth, suddenly sporting cruise wear. It wasn&#39;t surprising that such intrusions on the ordinary sharpened my sense of the absurd and weakened my connection with convention. But what was lovely was that Mom&#39;s twisted wit also created a sense of wonder, humor, unlikely juxtapositions that whispered to me of a universe filled with the surprises of God. Once, years ago, she had a coronary crisis. My dad bustled her to the hospital. Death as the Doorway Dad was a retired Army colonel whose love of military order was both served and sabotaged by his obsession with all things technological. His office was a maze of jerry-rigged wires and surge protectors. Once he was sitting at a traffic light, mesmerized by the alternating time-and-temperature display on the bank sign at the corner. When the time changed to temperature, Dad obediently caromed into the intersection. The only problem was that the light was still red. This was the man who sat, lovingly if not distractedly, by Mom&#39;s bed in intensive care. There were tubes for oxygen and other functions, IV carts and monitors that looked like television screens. One showed heart activity, the other respiration. Dad stared at them, transfixed by the squiggling images. They showed, reassuringly, that Mom&#39;s heart was beating and her lungs were breathing. An evil idea evidently presented itself to my mother. Accordingly, she held her breath. The respiratory device flatlined, alarms went off, and Dad had to be revived himself. In the end, he made the final journey first.</p><h2>Note to Self</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>Robert O&#39;Neill was born and raised in Butte, Montana, and lived there for nineteen years until he joined the Navy in 1996.

Bates</h2><p>Artists, teachers, army officers, housewives, elderly people, parents, and children with vision problems write about their experiences with the Bates Method and giving up their glasses in <i>Better Eyesight</i>. Major eye conditions (myopia, astigmaticsm, farsightedness, presbyopia, amblyopia, strabismus, cataract, gluacome, blindness) are discussed by Bates, other opthalmologists, the medical community, and readers. The significance of this literature is both historical and immediate. For the first time, the connection between eyestrain to shoulder and neck pain, headaches, and other muscular tension is discussed.</p><p>Thomas R. Quackenbush is a West Coast vision educator who, in <i>Relearning to See</i>, gave readers the most thorough and technical description of the Bates Method of natural vision improvement currently in existence. He showed how relearning correct vision habits and skills ("sketch, breathe, and blink") could loosen the rigidity of head, eye, and neck muscles that results in blur.</p><h2>Measuring and Monitoring Biological Diversity.

Although &#x201c;magic realism&#x201d; is a term today more commonly associated with the 20th-century literature of Latin America, it was first coined in 1925 by the German art historian and critic Franz Roh to describe an emerging style of modern realist paintings with fantasy or dreamlike subjects, and is often seen as parallel to or overlapping with the New Objectivity movement. Published to accompany a major display at Tate Modern in London, Magic Realism draws upon the remarkable assembly of German and Austrian paintings in the George Economou Collection and features rarely seen work by Otto Dix, George Grosz, Christian Schad, and Jeanne Mammen among many others.</p><p>Matthew Gale is Curator (Modern Art) and Head of Displays, Tate Modern.

If you&#x2019;re feeling ambitious, try making homemade ketchup and mustard first!</p> <p><b></b></p> <b>Directions</b> <p></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 325ï¿½F (170ï¿½C, or gas mark 3). Have ready a 2-quart (2 L) glass or ceramic ungreased loaf pan. To make the glaze: In a small-size pot, combine the Sucanat, apple cider vinegar, yellow mustard, and water over medium heat. Whisk well and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the butter, and let melt. Stir to combine and set aside. To make the loaf : In a medium-size bowl, combine the ham, pork, eggs, bread crumbs, milk, and ketchup. Using clean hands, gently mix to combine. Gently press the mixture into the loaf pan and top with the pineapple, lightly pressing the fruit into the loaf. Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and increase the oven temperature to 350ï¿½F (180ï¿½C, or gas mark 4). Pour the prepared glaze over the loaf. Return the pan to the oven and bake for 1 hour, uncovered. When done, the loaf will pull away slightly from the sides of the pan and the topping will be browned and caramelized. Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes.

Curtis argues that Britain is an &#39;outlaw state&#39;, often a violator of international law and ally of many repressive regimes. He reasons not only that Britain&#39;s foreign policies are generally unethical but that they are also making the world more dangerous and unequal. The Web of Deceit describes the staggering gulf that has arisen between New Labour&#39;s professed commitment to upholding ethical values and the reality of current policies. It outlines the new phase in global intervention, the immorality of British policy in Afghanistan, Kosovo, Iraq and Indonesia and support for repressive governments in Israel, Russia, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Curtis also reveals Britain&#39;s acquiescence in the Rwanda genocide and economic policies in the World Trade Organisation that are increasing poverty and inequality around the world. Drawing on formerly secret government files, the book also shows British complicity in the slaughter of a million people in Indonesia in 1965; the depopulation of the island of Diego Garcia; the overthrow of governments in Iran and British Guiana; repressive colonial policies in Kenya, Malaya and Oman; and much more.</p><p></p><h2>Tagebuch</h2><p>Used.

Dawkins. Dennett. -- This voluble triumvirate has gained oracular status for many scientists and laypersons in the contemporary world. But though the edifice of thought they have erected over and against tradition and faith has gained currency in today's nihilistic mind, it is now rapidly eroding in the serious world of ideas. <br><br>But what of that heady amalgam of Science and Christianity first put together by Teilhard de Chardin, which struck the Catholic world like a whirlwind around the time of the Second Vatican Council and continues to the present day in the work of such Catholic evolutionists as John Haught and Kenneth R. Miller? <br><br>What as a rule has rendered Catholics vulnerable to Teilhardian tenets -- apart from the fact that these conform to the neo-humanist tendencies of our age -- is that the theory is clad in scientific garb: in the modern world, where Science speaks, it appears even angels will listen. In <i>Theistic Evolution</i>, Wolfgang Smith shows himself to be that rare person thoroughly grounded in both science <i>and </i>theology, and what he proves through detailed and rigorous argument is that Teilhard de Chardin has in fact sold us a veritable science-fiction theology. <br><br>This book, however, is much more than a masterful and indeed definitive refutation of theistic evolutionism: it is at the same time an incomparable introduction to long-forgotten metaphysical and theological truths. In language at once precise and lucid the author recalls teachings going back to the Greek and Latin Fathers, and explains their bearing on questions about the nature of God and man bungled at the hands of many contemporary scientists and theologians.</p><p><br>After graduating from Cornell University at age eighteen with majors in physics, mathematics and philosophy, Wolfgang Smith took an M.S. from Purdue, following which he spent three years at Bell Aircraft Corporation as an aerodynamicist. During this period he gained recognition for his pioneering papers on the effect of diffusion fields, which provided a theoretical solution to the re-entry problem for space flight. After receiving a Ph.D. in mathematics from Columbia University, Dr. Smith pursued a professorial career in that field. Soon however his center of interest shifted from the pursuit of science to the critique of scientism and the rediscovery of metaphysics as a theological discipline. He has authored six books and numerous articles, and is today widely recognized as a leading authority in these twin fields."Wolfgang Smith is as important a thinker as our times boast." --Huston Smith, author of <i>The World's Religions</i><br><br>"Wolfgang Smith broaches a vast range of subjects with a mastery that bespeaks an immense culture." --Jean Borella, author of <i>The Sense of the Supernatural</i> and <i>The Secret of the Christian Way</i><br><br>"Here is that rare person who is equally at home with Eckhart and Einstein, Heraclitus and Heisenberg!" --Harry Oldmeadow, author of <i>Touchstones of the Spirit: Essays on Religion, Tradition &amp; Modernity</i></p><h2>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p><p><b>The very best of James Thurber's hilarious short stories and essays, to tie-in with the major new film starring Ben Stiller and Kristen Wiig. </b></p><p>Walter Mitty is an ordinary man living an ordinary life.

Six-year-old Nemo (Latin for <i>no one</i>) falls asleep in his bed and is transported to the fantastical Slumberland--at the request of King Morpheus--where he encounters all kinds of strange creatures. At the end of each trip he wakes up, unsure of what was real and what was a dream. The exquisitely detailed, art-nouveau-style colored panels in this edition are reproduced from rare, vintage file-copy pages. Alongside George Herriman's bizarre <i>Krazy Kat</i>, McCay's work helped to create the grammar of comic art. This Little Nemo collection--an entertaining romp into Slumberland--also provides a lovely glimpse into the origins of an art form.McCay is considered one of the pioneers of comic strips and animation, and here the complete Little Nemo comic strip from 1905 to 1907 is reprinted in color.-- <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Samuel Blink and the Forbidden Forest</h2><p>Living in Norway with their eccentric Aunt Eda, Samuel and Martha have been warned to never go into the backyard, thus when Samuel discovers a book in the attic that talks about the creatures that live out back and starts to see them with his own eyes, he begins to think that his aunt may not be as crazy as he once thought.</p><p>Matt Haig is the author of two adult novels, <i>The Dead Fathers Club</i> and <i>The Last Family in England.</i> UK reviewers have said of his writing: ï¿½&#x201c;totally engrossing,ï¿½&#x201d; ï¿½&#x201c;touching, quirky and macabre,ï¿½&#x201d; ï¿½&#x201c;a comic tour de force,ï¿½&#x201d; and ï¿½&#x201c;so surprising and strange that it vaults into a realm all of its own . . . most of all it allows Haig to indulge his innocently acute eye for detail and his delightfully weird imagination.ï¿½&#x201d; <i>Samuel Blink and the Forbidden Forest</i> is his first novel for young readers.

Courage, friendship, loyalty, honesty, self-discipline, compassion, responsibility, friendship, work, and faith are represented, with an introduction and commentary for each. Classics such as O. Henry's "The Gift of the Magi" and "Echo and Narcissus" are indicative of compassion. A sweet, illuminating letter from "F. Scott Fitzgerald to His Daughter" lays out her responsibilities. An account by Helen Keller of meeting her teacher, Anne Sullivan, provides a beautiful portrait of friendship. And poignant examples of courage are presented back to back in "Excerpt from the Diary of Anne Frank" and the poem "If?" by Rudyard Kipling. This old-fashioned volume may not be picked up by today's world-weary readers, but those who do dip into it will find that every generation had its share of problems addressed by eloquent and, yes, virtuous writers.?Julie Halverstadt, Douglas Public Library District, Castle Rock, CO<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Life on a Pioneer Homestead (Picture the Past)</h2><p>The Picture the Past series looks at the many kinds of communities in America's past.

From first ladies to freethinkers, educators to explorers, this exceptional group includes Abigail Adams, Margaret Bayard Smith, Martha Jefferson, Dolley Madison, Elizabeth Monroe, Louisa Catherine Adams, Eliza Hamilton, Theodosia Burr, Rebecca Gratz, Louisa Livingston, Rosalie Calvert, Sacajawea, and others.

Narrating with vivid insight, bemused wonder, humor, and a soft Southern accent, Roberts sheds a fresh perspective upon the lives of these strong, brave women, who were captivated by America&#39;s birth and political intrigue, even amidst personal hardships. A small weakness is the absence of pauses before and after quotations (mostly from letters), which causes some confusion as to what is a quote and what is text. Overall, though, Roberts is an insightful and passionate reader who delights in her subjects&#39; daily lives, triumphs, outrages, and humor.

DeMers, UPI food editor and author of The Community Kitchens Complete Guide to Gourmet Coffee, follows the long-lived landmark restaurant through its tumultuous past to a rosy, profitable present day. The recipes, which bear eponymous, self-consciously cute names, represent Creole cuisine, which takes a strong cue from classic French cookery. Accordingly, they are quite complicated and time consuming, at times calling for duck and veal stocks or involving several sauces in a single dish. Some of the simpler, tempting specialties include a shrimp saute with whiskey, corn and heavy cream; scallops with curry powder and apples; trout with carrot and cucumber balls and chopped hazelnuts; boneless duck breasts glazed in blueberry vinegar and garnished with fresh blueberries; sweetbreads with wild mushrooms; and pasta salad with crabmeat and Dijon mustard dressing.

The natural history we know is a lie, a falsehood sold to us by wicked old men who would make the world a dull gray prison and protect us from the dangers inherent to freedom.

The time before our time was not a time of senseless natural struggle and reptilian rage, but a time of myth and sorcery.

Today, as Spain has become firmly integrated into the political and economic structures of the European Union, the long-held notion that the country's "historical destiny" has been somehow out of step with those of its neighbors no longer seems valid. Barton probes the extent to which Spain should be regarded as an exceptional case and provides a clear and balanced account of its strikingly rich and diverse history.<br></p><p>Spain is different' was for a long time the explanation proffered by historians when they sought to explain the course of the nation's exceptionally rich and varied history. Spain was the only region in the medieval West (along with Sicily) to experience Islamic conquest; the first nation to lay claim to a global empire and the first to lose it; and the country in which the extreme forces of the Left and the Right were to act out one of the bloodiest confrontations Europe has known. Today, however, as Spain has become firmly integrated into the political and economic structures of the European Union, the long-held notion that the country is a nation apart no longer seems valid. Simon Barton probes the extent to which Spain should be regarded as an exceptional case and provides a highly-readable, lucid and balanced account of its vibrant and colourful history, from its origins to the present day. <br><br>This second edition of a highly successful text has been revised and expanded in the light of new scholarship, and now features additional maps and figures.

Since then, she has been raised and homeschooled by her grandparents. Grandad is overworked and travels a lot; Grandma is much too strict and never lets her meet any children her own age. When Hayley does something wrong&#x2014;she is not quite sure what&#x2014;they pack her off to her aunts in Ireland. To Hayley&#x2019;s shock, her family is much bigger than she thought; to her delight, the children all play what they call &#x201c;the game,&#x201d; where they visit a place called &#x201c;the mythosphere.&#x201d; And while she plays the game, Hayley learns more about her own place in the world than she had ever expected. This original novella by Diana Wynne Jones is sharply funny, fast-paced, and surprising until its very end&#x2014;like all of this acclaimed author&#x2019;s work.</p><p>Diana Wynne Jones is the multiple award-winning author of dozens of books, including <i>Howl&#x2019;s Moving Castle</i> (made into an Oscar-nominated animated film by Hayao Miyazaki), the five-book Chrestomanci series, The Chronicler of Dalemank, <i>Fire and Hemlock,</i> and <i>The Tough Guide to Fantasyland.</i> She lives with her husband, the medievalist J. A. Burrow, in Bristol, England, the setting of many of her books. They have three grown children and five grandchildren.Grade 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;What if just outside of Earth's known atmosphere there sat another layer that was actually a different dimension? Such is the premise for this novel. For as long as she can remember, orphan Hayley has lived sequestered away with her strict grandmother and mysteriously busy grandfather. A chance meeting on an outing lands her in big trouble and she finds herself shipped off to stay with relatives in the country. Here Hayley meets dozens of cousins who invite her to play a strange game. Its object is to go to different places in the mythosphere and retrieve various items while dodging mythological creatures. The plot thickens when she meets her father and learns that he and her mother are both trapped in the mythosphere as punishment for their illicit marriage. Hayley frees them and discovers that she, like all of the other characters in the story, is really a mythological figure who can live in either realm. Meanwhile, the frightening family patriarch, Uncle Jolyon, finds out about the game and comes after the girl, her parents, and her cousins. As he prepares to punish them all, Hayley pierces his chest with a star, causing him to transform into the planet Jupiter. While the beginning parallels <i>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</i>, the story takes off on its own midway through. There is a whole lot of plot for such a little novel, and readers unfamiliar with mythology won't fully appreciate it.&#x2014;<i>Nicki Clausen-Grace, Carillon Elementary School, Oviedo, FL</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tour.</p><p>Winston Groom is the author of eleven books, including Forrest Gump, Better Times Than These, As Summers Die, and the prize-winning Civil War history Shrouds of Glory. He served in the Vietnam War as a lieutenant with the Fourth Infantry Division. His non-fiction book, Conversations With the Enemy was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.Groom is the author of <i>Forrest Gump</i>, which was originally published in 1986 and then recently zoomed up the best-seller lists in the wake of the movie version's great success. In light of that circumstance, many people are going to be seeking his latest work. But--caveat emptor--not all who enjoyed that movie will enjoy this book. It will appeal to a select group: those who are avid readers of military history. Groom spent four years in research, prompted by personal interest: his great-grandfather's engagement as a soldier in the episode he chronicles here, the Confederacy's "last great offensive." The months between the Battle of Atlanta in July 1864 and the Battle of Nashville in December of that year were witness to the South's final attempt to throw off inexorable strangulation by the North. (This unsuccessful campaign was followed by the Union's coup de gr{&#x192;}ace, delivered by Grant shortly afterward in Virginia.) There's lots of battlefield maneuvering of this unit and that brigade, a level of detail that definitely calls for keen readership interest, but the you-are-there atmosphere is faultless.

Each tells a story&#x2014;about the person who laid his or her hands to the work; about the historical moment in which it was created; and about the political mood, community, and cultural forces that gave rise to that design. <br><br>The only book of its kind and the companion book to the PBS series of the same name, <i>Craft in America</i> highlights the work of America&#x2019;s most interesting craft artists past and present. Illustrated with more than 200 commanding images and signature objects from furniture, wood, ceramics, and glass to fiber, quilts, jewelry, metal, and basketry, this definitive work shows how crafts, long admired for their marriage of functionality and creativity, also reflect our nation&#x2019;s history and the remarkable people who passed on their traditions. <br><br>The last two hundred years have brought extraordinary transformation to America&#x2014;not just in the landscape and culture but also to the myriad communities that crisscross the continent. Organized by the societies in which our many craft traditions originated, <i>Craft in America</i> introduces the virtuoso craftspeople who expressed and elevated the values and ideals of their groups&#x2014;ideals that have become quintessentially American. From American Indians and enslaved Africans who worked with indigenous materials to religious people such as Shakers, whose clean lines reflect adherence to simplicity; from designers of the Arts and Crafts Movement for whom handmade objects held a moral integrity and righteousness to the government-sponsored WPA artists who created in the service of their nation, to today&#x2019;s studio artists reimagining meaning and methods, <i>Craft in America</i> unfolds a rarely examined side of our history. <br>Visceral, important, and seductively beautiful, and with a prologue from former president Jimmy Carter, <i>Craft in America</i> showcases some of the most important American objects. In these pages, you will discover how handcrafted objects are not only essential to daily life but how they are also a culture&#x2019;s tribute to its own character and place in history. They embody the desire to remember, reflect, and connect, serving as bridges among individuals, community, and the environment. <br><br><i>Craft in America</i> will take you on an aesthetic adventure through the evolution of craft and reveal what makes American crafts uniquely ours.

Once a widow, twice divorced, she&#x2019;s a woman with a past she prefers keeping to herself.<br> <br>Enter Cavin Lattimore. He&#x2019;s handsome, kind, charming, and the surgeon assigned to Tara following a ski accident in Lake Tahoe. In the weeks it takes her to recover, Cavin sweeps her off her feet and their relationship blossoms into something Tara had never imagined possible. But then she begins to notice some strange things: a van parked outside her home at odd times, a break-in, threatening text messages and emails. She also starts to notice cracks in Cavin&#x2019;s seemingly perfect personality, like the suppressed rage his conniving teenage son brings out in him, and the discovery that Cavin hired a detective to investigate her immediately after they met.<br> <br>Now on crutches and housebound, Tara finds herself dependent on the new man in her life&#x2014;perhaps too much so.

Hardwood gleams beneath the December sun flurrying down through the fog-misted skylight, and the place smells more like floor polish than the afternoon regulars&#x2019; liberal drips of sweat. Even the Pilates mats manage to shed the odor of perspiration, and that pleases me. I prefer to inhale the scent of exertion only during coition.<br> <br>Coition. Good word. Appears before &#x201c;coitus&#x201d; in the dictionary, and though they mean the same thing, the softer &#x201c;shun&#x201d; sounds chicer than the &#x201c;tus&#x201d; to my ear. Not that class is requisite to the act itself, but in conversation, tone is everything.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tara! Concentrate. Your form is terrible. Straighten your back. Lift your chest.&#x201d;<br> <br>I do as instructed but complain, &#x201c;Squats stink. And anyway, I thought you appreciated my form.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nick slinks closer, bends to lower his face close to mine, and I wait for his tongue to tease the pulse beneath my ear. Instead, he slaps my behind, hard enough to sting. &#x201c;You told me your goal is perfection. You&#x2019;re not there yet.&#x201d; His words slap sharper than the gesture. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why you need me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Honestly, most personal trainers could accomplish the task. I&#x2019;ve handpicked a half dozen over the years, trying them on for size, so to speak. I&#x2019;ve kept Nick the longest because of ability above and beyond, not to mention outside of the gym.<br> <br>I do enjoy specialized service, and Nick has exceptional talents. Still, he has bruised my ego.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need you at all, Mr. de la Rosa. In fact, I think we&#x2019;re finished&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; The look on his face is priceless. I&#x2019;m an excellent tipper. &#x201c;With squats and thrusts and weights, at least for today. As for the postworkout workout, give me thirty to shower and I&#x2019;ll meet you out front.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You are a wicked, wicked woman. Almost scary, in fact.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Almost? You underestimate me, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>Our little exchange did not go unnoticed, and envious eyes follow my retreat toward the women&#x2019;s shower room. That&#x2019;s correct, ladies. He and I are doing the filthy, and you&#x2019;re right to be jealous. What Nick de la Rosa may lack in discretionary income, he more than makes up for in carnal creativity. Who needs to go out when one can have so much fun staying in, playing doctor?<br> <br>My locker is well stocked with aromatic soaps and lotions, but before I use those I take a few minutes to douche away feminine fragrance, heightened by the previous ninety minutes of effort. One of my exes called me fastidious. Another claimed I&#x2019;m obsessively clean. But, as my late, great first husband once told me, &#x201c;A sweet pussy invites the tongue to tango.&#x201d; I plan on plenty of oral dance in an hour or so.<br> <br>Meanwhile, I run the water hot, perfume my hair with gardenia-scented shampoo, and soften my skin to silk with this fabulous vanilla-cedar shower gel. My eyes are closed against the final rinse of conditioner when a voice flutters softly within the tiled walls.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is that amazing incense smell?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s body wash from Kiehl&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Expensive?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not too.&#x201d; I blink away water, and when I identify the person on the far side of the conversation, I hope the showerhead&#x2019;s splash disguises the serrated intake of my breath.<br> <br>Penelope teaches yoga, and while she&#x2019;s something to see in a tank top and stretch pants, naked she is simply exquisite. In a side-by-side comparison, I can hold my own against pretty much any woman here. But Penelope is one of those rare young things whose obviously natural curves and fawn suede complexion rival anything my pricey plastic surgeon could accomplish. If I had hackles, they&#x2019;d be bristling.<br> <br>&#x201c;You can find the body wash online. Vanilla and cedarwood.&#x201d; I grab a towel, cover my imperfect assets, and try not to stare at Penelope as she and I trade places.<br> <br>For the next twenty minutes, I work serums and moisturizer into my skin before applying foundation. Not sure why I&#x2019;m bothering. It will all come dripping off in a little while. Oh well. At least I&#x2019;ll look attractive until then and turn a few heads on my way to the door.<br> <br>December shrouds San Francisco in gray. I step out into the heavy, wet curtain and am happy I took the time to blow-dry my hair, which is long and thick and would stay damp otherwise. My stylist calls it problematic because it takes extra time to color. But I&#x2019;m determined to keep it as close to its original fox red as possible. My sister is two years younger, and at not quite thirty-nine her hair has gone completely silver. It&#x2019;s actually striking on her, but the look would be wrong for me.<br> <br>I stand back against the building beneath a wide awning, watching sidewalk travelers hustle by. Everyone walks quickly here, worried more about what&#x2019;s behind them than the appointments waiting for them up ahead. It&#x2019;s an eclectic stream&#x2014;high school kids with prominent piercings, street dwellers of various ages and genders, a young black woman in short leather, an older white man in ankle-length mink.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s quite the show, and I&#x2019;m enjoying it well enough until it strikes me that I&#x2019;ve been loitering here for a very long time. I look in through the big plate-glass window, beyond weight machines and treadmills. Oh, there he is, in loose jeans and a flimsy flannel shirt that doesn&#x2019;t exactly hide all the lovely musculature I&#x2019;ve almost memorized.<br> <br>Nick starts in this direction, but before he can take a dozen steps, Penelope cozies up behind him, pouts against the back of his neck, and lifts on her toes slightly, saying something into his ear. He spins and now his face is hidden. But I can see hers clearly. Her smile is more than flirtatious. It&#x2019;s tinted with affection. And her eyes, locked on his, tell a story I really don&#x2019;t want to know.<br> <br>I have hackles after all. Rage sizzles, white-hot, and my hands tremor. Unreasonably, it&#x2019;s Penelope my inner bitch wants to maul. It&#x2019;s not her fault Nick wants his steak and his cupcake, too. She must sense the devil&#x2019;s gaze, because her head swivels, side to side. When she glances over Nick&#x2019;s shoulder and notices me glaring through the glass, she gives him a playful shove. Does she realize he&#x2019;s meeting me? Do they have some quirky arrangement?<br> <br>Nick turns his back on pretty Penelope, heads straight for the door, and when it opens a shock wave of anger hits him square. He looks at me, and I swear he has no idea why I&#x2019;m pissed. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br> <br>I force my voice low and level. &#x201c;Why do you think something&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t know, Tara. Maybe it&#x2019;s your body language.&#x201d; He reaches for my elbow, tries to steer me clear of curious eyes on the far side of the window.<br> <br>I yank my arm away and hold my ground. &#x201c;Do not touch me again unless I say it&#x2019;s okay. Understand?&#x201d; He nods, dumbstruck, and I continue. &#x201c;Does she know we&#x2019;re sleeping together?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Does who know?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop playing stupid! God, I hate when men play stupid! Penelope. Does she know? You two obviously have something going on.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nick starts up the sidewalk, sure I&#x2019;ll follow, or at the very least let him leave me standing here like an idiot. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t own me, bitch.&#x201d;<br> <br>I have no choice but to take the bait. But I&#x2019;m not going to be gutted without a fight. I catch up to him and strike from behind, jabbing with words. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Nick. I thought you liked our arrangement, that it was mutually beneficial.&#x201d;<br> <br>He stops, turns to face me. &#x201c;I do like it. But there was never any mention of exclusivity.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You are seeing Penelope, then?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, yeah. And others. It&#x2019;s not like I&#x2019;m engaged to any of you. Like I said, you don&#x2019;t own me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Maggot.<br> <br>&#x201c;I believe you said, &#x2018;You don&#x2019;t own me, bitch.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>The smirk slips from his face. &#x201c;Uh yeah, guess I did, and I&#x2019;m sor&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shut up.&#x201d; Damage control? I don&#x2019;t think so. &#x201c;No one talks to me like that, Nick, least of all hired help. And, make no mistake, that&#x2019;s exactly what you are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. uh, were. I do hope your &#x2018;others&#x2019; are as generous as I have been, because there will be no more under-the-table supplemental income from me. Come to think of it, I might have to 1099 you.&#x201d;<br> <br>My turn to smirk, and he doesn&#x2019;t like it. &#x201c;Go ahead and try. You paid me in cash and can&#x2019;t prove a thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>That makes me laugh. &#x201c;Do you really think I wouldn&#x2019;t take steps to protect myself, just in case you turned out to be the weasel you are? You know those nanny-cam things? So happens I have a boudoir cam. I don&#x2019;t suppose you ever noticed I always paid you before you got out of bed?&#x201d;<br> <br>Not completely true, but close enough. The camera covers the entire room. Anyway, it&#x2019;s not like I&#x2019;d really 1099 him, but it won&#x2019;t hurt to make him sweat a little. Damn, I am going to miss his sweat. But I could never have sex with him again, knowing he might have just come from someone else&#x2019;s bed. Who wants to sleep with a harem?<br> <br>&#x201c;So, we&#x2019;re finished?&#x201d;<br> <br>Cheeky little bastard. &#x201c;You needed confirmation of that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What about the gym?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This city is crawling with personal trainers. I&#x2019;m sure I can find another one as multifaceted as you. Meanwhile, I can handle my own workouts. I really don&#x2019;t need you, or anyone, to tell me how to squat.&#x201d; I start to walk away. Turn back. &#x201c;You never did say if Penelope knew about me.&#x201d;<br> <br>He stares at me stupidly for a moment. Then he dares, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see the need to disclose the dirty details.&#x201d;<br> <br>My hackles lower and I smile. &#x201c;I think I should take up yoga. Don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>I turn my back on him, and as I start to walk away he calls, &#x201c;You say one word to her and you will be very sorry.&#x201d;<br> <br>In a low, measured voice, I reply, &#x201c;I hope that&#x2019;s not a threat. This is a game you can&#x2019;t win.&#x201d;<br> <br>He changes tactics. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t understand. I love her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then why have you been fucking me?&#x201d;<br> <br>I leave before he can answer. Wounded. Envious. I don&#x2019;t even know what love feels like. It&#x2019;s unfair an asshole like Nick should know. But if it&#x2019;s even remotely like having sex on the side with whomever, all the while claiming your heart is taken, maybe it&#x2019;s just as well that it&#x2019;s outside my realm of experience.</p><h2>See Delphi and Die: A Marcus Didius Falco Mystery (Marcus Didius Falco Mysteries)</h2><p>It&#x2019;s A.D. 76 during the reign of Vespasian, and Marcus Didius Falco, a Roman &#x201c;informer,&#x201d; has achieved much in his life.

Although understandable based upon his life experiences, I consciously chose not to be poisoned by all that had been thrown in my path. I consciously chose a different route. God allowed me to experience &#39;post traumatic growth&#39; in my healing journey. My story differs from the one that Tom Cruise portrayed. I was not born on the 4th. I was Born on the 5th of July. For me, that means that, by God&#39;s grace, I was born in America, and He enabled me to follow the example of my father and serve my country in our nation&#39;s military. It also means I salute the flag and pledge my allegiance to &#39;one nation under God.&#39; It means there are some things worth fighting for, and, if need be, worth dying for. I&#39;m proud to be American and proud to be Born on the 5th of July.</p><p></p><h2>Bird Watching Watching: One Year, Two Men, Three Rules, Ten Thousand Birds</h2><p>Alex Horne describes the year he spent in a birdwatching competition with his father.

When they realized the surviving Blood were stunned by the violent loss of Queens and courts, they rebelled&#x2014;and decided that dying by the thousands was an acceptable price to pay in order to wipe out the Blood in Dena Nehele.</p><p>So the landens died during those first days of the uprising. Oh, how they died.</p><p>But so did the Blood.</p><p>The males in the Blood&#x2019;s towns and villages died as they exhausted the power that made the Blood who and what they were, until even the ones who wore Jewels and had a reservoir of power had used up everything they had in the effort to defend the women and children who didn&#x2019;t have the strength or skill to defend themselves.</p><p>When that power that lived within them was gone, they fought with weapons like any other man. But the landens kept coming, kept fighting&#x2014;and the Blood, outnumbered, had no chance of surviving.</p><p>Women and children died, along with the men. The landens, steeped in their hatred for the Blood, set fire to the buildings, turning entire villages into funeral pyres.</p><p>Then the rogues, trained warriors who had refused to serve any Queen, came down from the mountains&#x2014;and the battle for Dena Nehele really began.</p><p>He rode with one pack of rogues, a leader committed to slaughter in order to defend what was left of his people. But as they reached a walled estate on their way to the town that served as Dena Nehele&#x2019;s capital, he pulled his horse aside and stared through the iron bars of a double gate at the big stone mansion.</p><p>Grayhaven.</p><p>It was his family name. This was his family&#x2019;s home.</p><p>He had never lived in that mansion because the Queens who had controlled Dena Nehele had claimed it for their own residence, their own seat of power. And like the rest of the Territory, the house and the land had declined under the rule of bitches who had stood in the shadow of Dorothea SaDiablo, the High Priestess of Hayll.</p><p>He had grown up in the mountain camps ruled by the rogues because he was the last of his line, the last direct descendant of Lord Jared and Lady Lia, the Queen who, like her grandmother before her, had been called &#x201c;the Gray Lady.&#x201d; And if there was any truth to the family stories, he was the last person capable of finding the key that would reveal a treasure great enough to restore Dena Nehele.</p><p>Lord Jared had told his grandsons about the treasure the Gray Lady and Thera, a powerful Black Widow, had hidden somewhere around Grayhaven. While the family still lived in the house, every male had searched for it, and the story had spread to trusted advisers who shouldn&#x2019;t have been trusted. When the family line failed to produce even a minor Queen, Dorothea&#x2019;s pet Queens had descended on Dena Nehele like scavengers fighting over a fresh carcass. What was left of his family abandoned Grayhaven and spoke the family name only in secret.</p><p>Generations had tried to hold on to something that was Dena Nehele, that was the Blood as they had been when the Gray Lady had ruled. Generations of the Grayhaven line had been &#x201c;broken into service&#x201d; as a way of keeping the people yoked to the rule of unworthy Queens.</p><p>Generations of suffering&#x2014;until that witch storm swept through Terreille. A fast, violent storm, terrible in its cleansing, it had swept away Dorothea SaDiablo and everyone who had been tainted by her, but it had left the surviving Blood prey to the landens&#x2019; hatred.</p><p>&#x201c;Theran!&#x201d; one of the Warlords shouted. &#x201c;The bastards have set fire to the south end of the town!&#x201d;</p><p>He wanted to ride through those gates, wanted to protect the only thing left of his own heritage. But he had been trained to fight, had been born to stand on a killing field. So he turned away from the house and land he wanted to reclaim.</p><p>But as he rode away, he promised himself that when the fires of rebellion were finally smothered, he would come back to his family&#x2019;s home.</p><p>If there was anything left.</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p><i>present</i></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>R</b>eaching the broken-down stone wall and the double gate that was half-torn from its hinges, Theran Grayhaven planted his feet in the exact spot where he&#x2019;d stood two years before. Now, finally, the landen uprising had been completely smothered, and the Blood&#x2014;those who were left&#x2014;could set about the business of trying to restore their land and their people.</p><p>If there was any way of restoring their people.</p><p>&#x201c;Since you invited them here, you&#x2019;re going to feel like a fool if you&#x2019;re still standing at the gate when the other Warlord Princes arrive.&#x201d;</p><p>Theran looked over his shoulder. He hadn&#x2019;t heard the other man approach, hadn&#x2019;t felt a warning presence. Even a month ago, being that careless would have gotten him killed.</p><p>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t be up before sunset,&#x201d; Theran said. &#x201c;It drains you too much.&#x201d;</p><p>The old man scowled at the wall and the gate&#x2014;and all the other signs of neglect. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll manage.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll need blood tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>The scowl deepened. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll manage.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Talon . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be using that voice on me, boy. I can still whack some sense into that stubborn head of yours.&#x201d;</p><p>Talon was a grizzled warrior who was missing two fingers on his left hand and half his right foot&#x2014;evidence of the price paid for the battles won. He was also a Sapphire-Jeweled Warlord Prince. Since Theran was a Warlord Prince who wore Green Jewels,Talon was the only man in Dena Nehele who was strong enough to &#x201c;whack some sense&#x201d; into him.</p><p>But only after the sun set.</p><p>Talon was demon-dead. If he was forced to act during daylight hours, his strength drained at a terrifying speed.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you ever wonder if it was worth it?&#x201d; Theran asked, looking away from the man who had raised him.</p><p>He had never known his father. The man had mated to continue the Grayhaven bloodline and had been caught, broken, and completely destroyed before Theran had been born.</p><p>When he was seven, his mother had brought him to the mountain camps to keep the Grayhaven line safe from Dorothea&#x2019;s pet Queens.</p><p>He never saw her again.</p><p>Talon looked at the mansion and shook his head. &#x201c;I was in this fight for three hundred years, give or take a few. I knew Lia, and I knew Grizelle before her. I stood with Jared and Blaed when we were all among the living&#x2014;and I stood with others when I became demon-dead. So I never wondered if bringing Dena Nehele back to the way it was when the Gray Ladies ruled was worth the blood and pain and lives that were lost. I <i>knew</i> getting that back was worth the price.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t win, Talon,&#x201d; Theran said softly. &#x201c;Someone else eliminated the enemy, but we still didn&#x2019;t win.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A Grayhaven is standing once more on the family land. That&#x2019;s a start. And there is a marker on the table.&#x201d;</p><p>A marker Talon hadn&#x2019;t told him about until a few days ago. &#x201c;A dangerous one, assuming the man who owes us a favor is still alive.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no way to win unless we gamble,&#x201d; Talon said. &#x201c;Come on. We&#x2019;ll bring the Coach onto the grounds and camp out here tonight. Tomorrow you can go through the house and see what needs to be done.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be lucky if we find anything intact,&#x201d; Theran said bitterly. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t imagine the bitches who ruled from here <i>not</i> trying to find the treasure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But the key wasn&#x2019;t in the house,&#x201d; Talon said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s part of the legend. And without the key that begins unlocking the spells, they could have ripped up every floorboard and knocked down every brick in every fireplace, and they still wouldn&#x2019;t have found the treasure even if they were looking right at it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t mean we&#x2019;re going to find a safe...</p></p><h2>Elaine and Bill: Portrait of a Marriage : The Lives of Willem and Elaine De Kooning</h2><p>Profiles the dynamic and tumultuous, 50-year, on-again, off-again &#34;open&#34; marriage of Willem and Elaine de Kooning, whose lives were at the epicenter of the postwar art world. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>An unvarnished life of ``action painter'' Willem de Kooning and his artist-wife, by Hall (past president of the Rhode Island School of Design; Betty Parsons, 1991--not reviewed). While focusing on the deeply troubled relationship between the introverted Dutch-born Abstract Expressionist and the ebullient Brooklyn woman he married, Hall also presents an overview of the couple's art-world contemporaries: Jackson Pollock and his wife, Lee Krasner; Arshile Gorky; Robert Motherwell; David Smith; Franz Kline--in Hall's telling, a pretty unappealing lot of bed-hopping brawlers, blowhards, and bigots. The de Kooning marriage was an open one with each partner engaging in a seemingly endless series of affairs: As her husband's reputation as a leader of the emerging New York School of the 1950's gathered steam, Elaine, in order to further his career, embarked on affairs with art critics Thomas Hess and Harold Rosenberg. Even so, fellow action-painter Jackson Pollock's reputation outshone de Kooning's, at least in the popular press, and the two men became rivals, not only for artistic kudos but also for women. Who could best hold his liquor also became a point of contention, though both ended up as alcoholics. When Pollock was killed in a car crash while drunk, de Kooning's reputation as ``the greatest American painter'' soared. His works commanded higher and higher prices--but his drinking escalated as well. The de Koonings eventually separated after Willem fathered an illegitimate child and Elaine sank into dipsomania. But after 20 years, the couple reunited, and Elaine, recovering from alcoholism, devoted her final years to protecting the health and reputation of her husband, who became ever more reclusive and detached. In 1989, Elaine died of lung cancer; today, the ``American Picasso'' has been declared mentally incompetent, his daughter and a lawyer acting as his co-conservators. Written in pedestrian prose--but nonetheless a continually engrossing, if depressing, portrait of an American master. (Sixteen pages of b&amp;w photographs--not seen) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The 46-year marriage of solitary, depressive Willem de Kooning, the Dutch-born American abstract expressionist, and gregarious, ebullient painter-critic Elaine Fried was a spiral of competition marked by sexual infidelities, fights and squalid alcoholism on both sides. Hall ( Betty Parsons ) claims the union, strained by an 18-year separation, nurtured the development of their personalities and art, but there is not much evidence for that in this intimate, engaging narrative based on the author's friendship with Elaine (who died in 1989) and on interviews with the couple's friends (Willem, now 89 and afflicted with Alzheimer's disease, was incapable of being interviewed). Hall portrays Elaine as a smart operator who helped establish her husband's reputation by having strategic sexual affairs with art critics Harold Rosenberg and Tom Hess. She limns a high-energy bohemian world of art, booze and talk.

The War and short-lived careers as an actress, model, and publishing editor gave her a degree of independence and experience that had been closed to her forebears, and brought her into contact with the artistic community that was to encompass her professional and private life. Her first novel was published in 1950 and her most recent in 1999.<br>Her circle of friends has included some of the most interesting writers and thinkers of the day - Laurie Lee, Arthur Koestler, Olivia Manning, Cyril Connolly, Ken Tynan and Cecil Day-Lewis, among many others. She has been married three times - firstly to Peter Scott, the naturalist and son of Captain Scott, and most famously and tempestously to Kingsley Amis.</p><p>Born in 1923, Elizabeth Jane Howard has written eleven previous novels, most recently the Cazalet Chronicle, comprising The Light Years, Marking Time, Confusion and Casting Off</p><h2>The Barefoot Book of Jewish Tales</h2><p>Collects traditional Jewish folk stories gathered from many times and places that deal with important questions that challenge everyone.</p><p>Rabbi Shoshana Boyd Gelfand was ordained in 1993 at the Jewish Theological Seminary, and currently serves as the director of JHub, a program that promotes social action, innovation and social entrepreneurship in the British Jewish community. As the mother of three young children, she understands well how to engage children with stories that are vivid and interesting. Shoshana lives and works in North London.These eight tales from the Jewish tradition offer simple yet compelling messages. The virtues of prayer are compared to stories; Elijah the prophet explains his wisdom to an ordinary mortal; an illiterate boy finds that his good intentions are sufficient for God; a king learns to listen and accept his unusual son; a young woman offers her bread-making skills to God; an elderly woman views the difference between heaven and hell; a wise wife helps her husband comprehend her loyalty; and a king realizes that flaws are a part of life. Gelfand&#x2019;s language is simple and direct, and she appends her tales with explanations of the Jewish signs and symbols cited and a list of story sources. Hall&#x2019;s elegant full-color art suggests an Eastern European setting, and each tale includes distinctive borders, spot art, and occasional full-page spreads. The package also includes a CD with Debra Messing reading the stories. A perfect choice for sharing with young families, this will also be welcomed by religious school libraries.

Lindgren&#x2019;s children&#x2019;s books have sold over 144 million copies worldwide. Astrid Lindren (1907-2002) is the only children&#x2019;s author with a literary prize, a theme park, a museum, a satellite, and a minor planet named in her honor. (After this last honor, she suggested changing her name to &#x201c;Asteroid Lindgren.&#x201d;) A jury appointed by Swedish Radio&#x2019;s Culture Department to elect the &#x201c;Author of the Millennium&#x201d; voted Astrid Lindgren second after William Shakespeare. She was awarded the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for her contribution to international children's literature.</p><h2>Rocking Horse Christmas</h2><p>A rocking horse, outgrown by its little boy owner, faithfully waits by the attic window for his friend to return, in a holiday-appropriate story in the spirit of The Velveteen Rabbit.</p><p>Mary Pope Osborne is the acclaimed author of many books for children. She is best known for her Magic Tree House series as well as her titles in the Dear America and My America series. She lives with her husband in New York City.<br><br>A native of Washington, D.C., Ned Bittinger attended Landon School in Bethesda, Maryland, before leaving the area for Denison University in Ohio. He returned to D.C., however, to earn his Master's of Fine Arts degree at George Washington University, and now lives in Rappahannock County, Virginia, with his wife, Mary. Bittinger is an award-winning painter of portraits, and his subjects have included James A. Baker and Lawrence Eagleburger for the State Department; Shirley MacLaine; Nancy M. Kissinger; and many leaders of the corporate, legal, medical, and diplomatic professions.<br><br>Bittinger also paints landscapes and figurative scenes, and his work reflects the influence of such great artists as John Singer Sargent, Ilya Repin, Valentin Serov, and N.C. Wyeth. His use of the alla prima&#x201d; technique, in which wet paint is skillfully manipulated, gives his brushwork and thus his paintings immediacy. It is this energy that makes his work particularly suited to illustration, and readers will remember his stunning paintings from Fran Manushkin's The Matzah That Papa Brought Home, Eve Bunting's The Blue and the Gray, and Mary Pope Osborne's Rocking Horse Christmas.<br>Kindergarten-Grade 3. A story that's as rich in the spirit of Christmas as it is spare in its choice of words. Thrilled with his present of a rocking horse, a boy takes all sorts of wonderful imaginary trips. As he grows up he moves on to other interests. Meanwhile, the horse laments his playmate's absence. Finally, it is relegated to the attic. Years later, a small boy discovers the horse with delight. For this had been his father's horse, his "oldest friend in the world." And soon this new boy and the old horse gallop away to their own adventures. Bittinger's oil paintings on linen are rich in palette and detail. The cover and the title-page illustrations showing Santa making and delivering the horse might well go unnoticed, but they are intrinsic to this story and so much a part of its charm. The scenes where the boy's imaginative play surrounds him with cowboys, knights, race horses, and jungle animals are so alive with motion and energy that they fairly leap off the page. The unnamed youngster could be any boy and this horse could be any toy, any treasure, that enables a child to become an adult made richer by memories and imagination. The theme of toys outgrown and put aside but not forgotten is so well-done here that it will strike a chord with many children.<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Best Karate, Vol.5: Heian, Tekki (Best Karate Series)</h2><p>Kata, the formal exercises of karate training, were the essence of practice in Okinawa and China, and are the core training method even today.<br><br>Detailed here in 1500 sequential photos are the five Heian and three Tekki kata, mastery of which is necessary to attain first dan. <br><br>Demonstrated by the author and Yoshiharu Osaka.</p><p><br>MASATOSHI NAKAYAMA carries on the tradition of his teacher, Gichin Funakoshl, the Father of Modern Karate.

Though he&#x2019;d planned his escape for days, he gathered only a few supplies and keepsakes before departing, careful not to give his wife any hint of what he intended to do. None of his possessions mattered more than getting safely away with his son.</p> <p>He knew the disaster could come soon&#x2014;any day now. Lee Iswander, the Roamer industrialist, dismissed Garrison&#x2019;s concerns about third-order tidal shifts in the broken planet; Garrison&#x2019;s own wife, Elisa, didn&#x2019;t believe him. The lava miners paid little attention to his warnings, not because they disputed his geological calculations, but because they didn&#x2019;t <i>want</i> to believe. Their priorities were clear. Adding &#x201c;unnecessary&#x201d; and expensive levels of redundant shielding and &#x201c;paranoid&#x201d; safety measures was irresponsible, both to Iswander Industries and to the employees, who participated in profit-sharing.</p> <p>Lee Iswander had commissioned follow-up reports, biased reports, that painted a far rosier picture. Garrison didn&#x2019;t accept them.</p> <p>So he made his choice, the only possible choice. He stole one of the company ships, and when she found out about it, Elisa would claim that he stole their son.</p> <p>He flew out of the Sheol system, running far from any Roamer settlement or Confederation outpost. Elisa was not only an ambitious woman, she was abusive, tenacious, and dangerous&#x2014;and she would come after them. He needed a head start if he had any hope of getting away.</p> <p>The ship was a standard Iswander cargo transport, a workhorse, fully fueled with ekti, run by an efficient Ildiran stardrive. Garrison could fly the vessel without special training, as he could fly most standard spacecraft.</p> <p>Ten-year-old Seth rode in the cockpit next to him. Garrison made a game of familiarizing the boy with cockpit systems and engine diagnostics, giving him simple navigation problems to solve&#x2014;as any good Roamer father would, even though Garrison had chafed under how <i>his</i> stern father had raised <i>him</i>. He would not make the same mistakes with Seth.</p> <p>Roamers were free spirits, sometimes deprecatingly called space gypsies, whose clans filled niches too rugged and dangerous for more pampered people&#x2014;places such as the Sheol lava-processing operations. He had followed Elisa there because of her promotion in Iswander Industries.</p> <p>&#x201c;You should stay away from That Woman,&#x201d; Olaf Reeves had warned him, not once but dozens of times. &#x201c;If you defy me, if you marry her, you will regret it. You are spitting on your heritage.&#x201d;</p> <p>Now, Garrison hated to admit that his father had been right.</p> <p>He closed his eyes, took a breath, and opened them. He studied the markers on the ship&#x2019;s copilot control panels, then turned to his son. &#x201c;Go ahead and set the next course, Seth.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But where are we going?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You pick, so long as we&#x2019;re heading away from Sheol.&#x201d; He tapped the starscreen, which showed infinite possibilities. &#x201c;On this trip, we&#x2019;re truly roaming. I just need some time away from everybody so I can rethink things.&#x201d;</p> <p>Though anxious, the boy was glad to be with his father. Seth respected his mother, even feared her, but he loved his father. Elisa never let down her walls&#x2014;not with any business associate, not with Garrison, not even with her own son.</p> <p>&#x201c;Will I be able to go to Academ now?&#x201d; Seth asked. The Roamer school inside a hollowed-out comet had always fascinated the boy. He wanted to be with the children of other clans, to have <i>friends.</i> Garrison knew his son would be happier at Academ, but Elisa had refused to consider sending their son there.</p> <p>&#x201c;Maybe we&#x2019;ll arrange that before long. For now, you can learn from me.&#x201d;</p> <p>Unlike other Roamer children, Seth hadn&#x2019;t grown up in a pleasant domed greenhouse asteroid or on the open gas-giant skies of an ekti-harvesting skymine. Rather, his daily view was a blaze of scarlet magma erupting in a smoke-filled sky. All the personnel of the lava-mining facility lived in reinforced habitat towers mounted on pilings sunk down to solid rock. More than two thousand employees, specialists of various ranks&#x2014;engineers like Garrison himself, metallurgists, geologists, shipping personnel, and just plain grunt workers&#x2014;filled shifts aboard the smelter barges or control towers, surrounded by fires that could have inspired Hell itself.</p> <p>No other parents kept their children here. Sheol was no place for a family, no home for a boy, regardless of the career advancement opportunities for Elisa.</p> <p>As the two closely orbiting halves of the binary planet adjusted their dance of celestial mechanics, Garrison had analyzed the orbital pirouette, uncovering fourth-order resonances that he suspected would make the fragments dip fractionally closer to each other, increasing stresses. He studied the melting points, annealing strengths, and ceramic-lattice structure of the habitat and factory towers.</p> <p>And he realized the danger to the Iswander operations.</p> <p>Alarmed, he had presented his results to Lee Iswander, only to be rebuffed when neither the industrialist nor his deputy&#x2014;Garrison&#x2019;s own wife&#x2014;took his warnings seriously. Iswander impatiently told Garrison to go back to work and reassured him that the lava-processing outpost was perfectly safe. The material strength of the structural elements was rated to withstand the environment of Sheol, although with little margin for error.</p> <p>When Garrison insisted, Iswander grudgingly brought in a team of contract geologists and engineers who found a way to rerun the calculations, to reaffirm that nothing could go wrong. The specialists had departed with surprising haste&#x2014;worried about their own safety?</p> <p>Garrison still trusted his own calculations, though. Next, he felt it was his responsibility to warn the Sheol employees, which infuriated Elisa, who was sure that his whistle-blowing would cost her a promotion.</p> <p>Honestly, Garrison hoped he was wrong. He knew he wasn&#x2019;t. Convinced he had no alternative, he decided to take Seth away from Sheol before disaster struck.&#x2026;</p> <p>After scanning the star catalog, the boy chose coordinates that qualified as little other than &#x201c;the middle of nowhere.&#x201d; The stardrive engines hummed and changed tone as they adjusted course, and the vessel streaked off again.</p> <p>Seth looked up at him with a sparkle in his eyes. &#x201c;If we had our own compy, Dad, he could fly the ship, and you and I could play games.&#x201d;</p> <p>Garrison smiled. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re on autopilot. We can still play games.&#x201d;</p> <p>Because there were no other children on Sheol, Seth had longed for a competent computerized companion, probably a Friendly model who could keep him company and amuse him. At the lava-mining facility, Lee Iswander used only a handful of Worker compies, none of which were the more sociable types, not even a Teacher compy.</p> <p>&#x201c;Your mother didn&#x2019;t see the point in owning a compy,&#x201d; Garrison said. &#x201c;But maybe we can revisit that.&#x201d; <i>After we see what happens.</i></p> <p>In his head, Garrison heard his father&#x2019;s gruff voice again. &#x201c;You never should have married That Woman. You&#x2019;re a Roamer, and you belong with other Roamers!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Elisa&#x2019;s not a Roamer, but Lee Iswander comes from a good clan,&#x201d; he had responded, though the words sounded flat in his own ears.</p> <p>&#x201c;That man has more of the Hansa about him than the clans. He&#x2019;s forgotten who he is.&#x201d; The bearded clan patriarch had waved a finger in front of his son&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;And if you stay with him, you will forget who you are. Too many Roamer clans have forgotten. A knife loses its edge unless it is sharpened.&#x201d;</p> <p>But Garrison had refused to listen and married Elisa Enturi anyway. He&#x2019;d given up so much for her&nbsp;&#x2026; or had he done it just to act out against his father? He had wanted a family, a fulfilled life, and Elisa wanted something else.</p> <p>&#x201c;If we find a place and settle down, will Mother come to live with us again?&#x201d; Seth asked.</p> <p>Garrison didn&#x2019;t want to lie. He stared out at the forest of stars ahead and the great emptiness in which they had lost themselves. &#x201c;She wants to take her chances at Sheol for now.&#x201d;</p> <p>The boy looked sad but stoic. &#x201c;Maybe someday.&#x201d;</p> <p>Garrison could not envision any other answer but <i>Maybe someday</i>.</p> <p>Still running, they crossed the expansive emptiness for days, and then they encountered an amazing anomaly: a cluster of gas bags far outside of any star system. Each bloated globule was twice the size of their ship.</p> <p>Garrison ran a quick diagnostic. &#x201c;Never seen anything like these.&#x201d;</p> <p>The membranous bubbles drifted along in a loose gathering with nothing but light-years all around them. In the dim light of faraway stars, the spherical structures appeared greenish brown, and each filmy membrane enclosed a blurry nucleus. Hundreds of thousands of them formed an island in a sea of stars.</p> <p>Seth studied both the sensor screens and the unfiltered view through the windowport. &#x201c;Are they alive?&#x201d;</p> <p>Garrison shut down the engines so their ship could drift toward them. &#x201c;No idea.&#x201d; The strange objects seemed majestic&#x2014;silent, yet powerful. Organic? They filled him with a sense of wonder. &#x201c;They remind me of&nbsp;&#x2026; space plankton.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re bloated and floating,&#x201d; Seth said. &#x201c;We should call them <i>bloaters.</i>&#x201d;</p> <p>A random glimmer of light brightened one of the nodules, an internal flash that faded. Then another bloater flickered and quickly faded.</p> <p>Close together at one of the windowports, they stared out at the view. &#x201c;If we discovered them, we can name them whatever we want,&#x201d; Garrison said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d say bloaters is a good name for them.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;So we just made a discovery?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Looks that way.&#x201d; He moored the ship among the thousands of silent, eerie nodules. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s stay here for a while.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright ï¿½ 2014 by Kevin J.

A fine copy in a fine dust jacket.</p><p>Mention the Arctic and most people think of the North Pole, polar bears, Eskimos, and a whole lot of ice and snow. That's fine, as far as it goes, but there's a lot more to the Arctic and subarctic than <i>Nanook of the North</i>. Consider, for example, the Ainu people of Hokkaido, an island of Japan, or the Chukchee of Siberia; add in the native peoples of Greenland, Canada, and the Aleutian Islands and you've got a vast geographical area diverse in cultures. Different as the traditions and individual ways of life might be from tribe to tribe and region to region, there are some fundamental similarities in Arctic peoples' experience--a harsh and unforgiving environment, hunting and fishing as a way of life, and, above all, a rich oral tradition. It is with this oral tradition that Howard Norman is chiefly concerned. He has collected 116 folktales from a variety of northern peoples and organized them into categories such as "Tricksters and Culture Heroes," "Shaman Stories," and "Stories of Strange and Menacing Neighbors," among others. Each section is prefaced with a short introduction that provides a solid basis for understanding important themes. Whales, skunks, cannibals, and ghosts are just some of the characters that populate these tales from the top of the world.Howard Norman is the author of numerous books, most recently <i>Devotion</i>, <i>In Fond Remembrance of Me</i>, and <i>The Bird Artist</i>. He was twice a finalist for the National Book Award in fiction and has received a Lannan Literary Award, three National Endowment for the Arts Fellowships, a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship, and the Harold Morton Landon Prize in translation from the Academy of American Poets.

We've had diary stories in THE DAILY EXPRESS, SUNDAY TELEGRAPH and BOOKSELLER. John Walsh gave it a wonderful plug in his column in THE INDEPENDENT as has Terence Blacker in his column Reviews have been excellent 'This is not a serious book by any means, but it is a welcome relief from the usual hagiographies found in Debrett's and Who's Who, which will set very comfortably on the bookshelves of those who have given up hope of an entry in either.'Ross Golden Bannon, THE SUNDAY BUSINESS POST 'I have not laughed so much in years, nor been so relieved that I did not know an author. You enter the world of William Donaldson at yourperil.'Byron Rogers, THE SPECTATOR 'This is probably the greatest bathroom book yet written.'Steve Jelbert, THE TIMES 'The most unputdownable anthology.... there's much to savour about this volume'John Walsh, THE INDEPENDENT 'In this breathtaking triumph of misdirected scholarship, Donaldson has found the ideal outlet for his splenetic wit and healthy disrespect for the great and the good.'Robert Chalmers, THE INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY 'This new 600-page encyclopedia is the funniest book of the year, and quite possibly of all time.'Francis Wheen, THE WEEK 'There is plenty here to titillate and entertain...... ifyou are curious to know who bottle-fed a porpoise in a railway waiting room (Francis Trevelyan Buckland), or which king died after being bitten by a monkey (Prince Phillip's father), or whose feet were cut off so that he could fitinto his sarcophagus (the 10th Duke of Hamilton) or which hangman later became a hairdresser (John Ellis), then this book is for you. It will make a goodbog-book, with oodles of human quiddity and notoriety to detain you.'Christopher Silvester, THE EXPRESS 'This book aims to catalogue the infamous and egregious from the 'undergrowth' of British and Irish history, and it certainly achieves this.'Charlie Campbell, LITERARY REVIEW 'The publishers wanted a 'browsable and addictive collection of pen portraits of 1,500 extraordinary characters' and Donaldson's flair for finding the extraordinary has fulfilled this brief amply - giving readers a glorious gawp into the lives of outsiders and outlaws past and present.'THE BIG ISSUE BREWER'S ROGUES VILLAINS AND ECCENTRICS has also been mentioned in a number of Christmas round-ups.

His UCLA teams reached unprecedented heights in the 1960s and '70s capped by a run of ten NCAA championships in twelve seasons and an eighty-eight-game winning streak, records that stand to this day. Wooden also became a renowned motivational speaker and writer, revered for his "Pyramid of Success."</p><p>Seth Davis of <i>Sports Illustrated</i> and CBS Sports has written the definitive biography of Wooden, an unflinching portrait that draws on archival research and more than two hundred interviews with players, opponents, coaches, and even Wooden himself. Davis shows how hard Wooden strove for success, from his All-American playing days at Purdue through his early years as a high school and college coach to the glory days at UCLA, only to discover that reaching new heights brought new burdens and frustrations. Davis also reveals how at the pinnacle of his career Wooden found himself on questionable ground with alumni, referees, assistants, and even some of his players. His was a life not only of lessons taught, but also of lessons learned.</p><p>Woven into the story as well are the players who powered Wooden's championship teams &#x2013; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Walton, Walt Hazzard, and others &#x2013; many of whom speak frankly about their coach. The portrait that emerges from Davis's remarkable biography is of a man in full, whose life story still resonates today.</p></p><p><b>Seth Davis</b> is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>When March Went Mad: The Game That Transformed Basketball</i> and the memoir <i>Equinunk, Tell Your Story: My Return to Summer Camp</i>. In 1995, he joined the staff of <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, where he is currently a senior writer. He is also an on-air studio analyst for CBS Sports and CBS Sports Network during coverage of college basketball and the NCAA tournament. A graduate of Duke University, he lives with his family in Los Angeles.<p>Prologue</p> <p>The Den</p> <p>The first thing you noticed were the books. Big books, little books, picture books, children&#x2019;s books, art books, religious books, coaching books, sports books, fiction books, science books. Before I walked through the door, they were there to greet me in tall, neat piles in the front hallway. The books were stacked on floors, lined up on tables, piled on desks, jammed into bookcases. The apartment was barely two thousand square feet, yet it seemed that most of it was covered by something that could be read.</p> <p>John Wooden was careful not to trip over the books as he made his way to his favorite easy chair in the den. Another dozen or so stood on the floor beside the chair, lined up as if on a shelf. The coffee table that sat in front of the television was likewise covered, a source of irritation for a man with a compulsive need for order. &#x201c;Organization was one of my strengths for a long time, but now just look at that table with all that stuff on it,&#x201d; he said as he invited me to sit on the couch. I asked Wooden how many of the books in that room he had read. &#x201c;Maybe half,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ve browsed them all.&#x201d;</p> <p>It was September 2006. Wooden was not quite ninety-six years old. Even at his advanced age, he was still a student of the world, eager to collect one more crumb of wisdom that he could dispense to the next friend, interviewer, former player, or stranger who came calling. Though his eyes were not as good as they used to be, and though he tired easily, this old widower still turned to books during those rare, quiet hours when he didn&#x2019;t have a visitor or the phone wasn&#x2019;t ringing. Besides keeping him company in the present, they also served as a tether to his past, a dog-eared monument to the person who influenced him more than any other: his father, Joshua Hugh Wooden.</p> <p>Hugh, as he was known, loved reading, both to himself and to his children. Though he did not have any formal education past high school, he was so facile with the English language that when he did crossword puzzles, he invented ways to make them more challenging. &#x201c;For instance, he&#x2019;d do it in a spiral form until he&#x2019;d end up putting the last letter right in the middle of it,&#x201d; said Billy Wooden, John&#x2019;s younger brother. After a hard day&#x2019;s work, Hugh loved nothing more than to sit down, crack open the Bible or another book, and read poetry to his four sons by the light of an oil lamp.</p> <p>&#x201c;I can just see my dad as I see you, if I close my eyes,&#x201d; Wooden said, doing just that. He channeled Hugh as he recited: <i>By the shores of Gitche Gumee, / by the shining Big-Sea-Water, / stood the wigwam of Nokomis, / daughter of the moon Nokomis.... </i>Upon completing the verse by Longfellow, Wooden opened his eyes. &#x201c;We had no electricity, no running water. He would read to us from the scriptures practically every night. For some reason, of all the poems he read, that&#x2019;s the only one I can just picture him doing.&#x201d;</p> <p>When he laid down his books, however, Hugh did not have a lot to say. &#x201c;He tried to get his ideas across, maybe not in so many words, but by action. He walked it,&#x201d; John said. Hugh didn&#x2019;t lecture his boys so much as he sprinkled seeds along their paths. When John graduated from the eighth grade, Hugh handed his son a small card upon which he had written his &#x201c;Seven-Point Creed.&#x201d; John later carried that piece of paper in his wallet until it wore out, whereupon he rewrote Hugh&#x2019;s words on a fresh card. After he retired from coaching basketball at UCLA, John had the creed printed up on slick plastic cards and handed them out so others could plant Hugh&#x2019;s seeds into their wallets as well.</p> <p>The first of the seven points paraphrased a line from <i>Hamlet</i>: &#x201c;Be true to yourself.&#x201d; Number four read, &#x201c;Drink deeply from good books.&#x201d; So John drank. As a young boy growing up in Indiana, he dove into the <i>Leatherstocking</i> tales and Tom Swift series. His favorite teachers at Martinsville High School were his English teachers. When he attended Purdue University, he became close with Martha Miller, an elderly librarian. Once, when he was coaching basketball at UCLA, Wooden was so taken by the enthusiasm evinced by a guest lecturer that he wandered into Powell Library to read more on the topic. He devoured Zane Grey&#x2019;s westerns and Leo Buscaglia&#x2019;s motivationals. Though his all-time favorite book was <i>The Robe</i> by Lloyd Douglas, his interest was truly piqued by books about his favorite historical figures&#x2014;Winston Churchill, Mahatma Gandhi, Abraham Lincoln, Mother Teresa. He lost count of how many books on those last two he had received as gifts.</p> <p>Then there were the poets. Dickens, Yeats, Tennyson, Poe, Byron, Shakespeare. Especially Shakespeare. In college, Wooden spent an entire semester studying <i>Macbeth</i>, followed by another semester just on <i>Hamlet</i>. His favorite sportswriter was Grantland Rice, who penned many of his columns in verse. Besides being the coauthor of nearly two dozen books, including four children&#x2019;s books, Wooden was himself a prolific amateur poet. An idea would strike him on his morning walk, and he would come home and scrawl some doggerel. He watched John Glenn orbit the Earth and Neil Armstrong walk on the moon, and he wrote poems about how those events made him feel. He set a goal of writing one hundred poems and assembling them in a compendium for his family. He structured the book into five tidy parts that reflected his love of balance: twenty poems each on family, faith, patriotism, nature, and fun. Even when he was well into his nineties, Wooden could still recite scores of poems from memory.</p> <p>During the final years of his life, Wooden received countless visitors in that modest, book-strewn den. In between tales of championships won and players coached, as he recounted the fascinating twists and turns of his long life, Wooden would invariably bring the conversation back to the man who raised him. When he closed his eyes and recited Longfellow to me, his mind was transported back to the farm. But if it felt like a full-circle moment, it really wasn&#x2019;t. You can&#x2019;t circle back to a place you never left.</p> <p>That, in essence, is the story of John Wooden&#x2019;s life, a quintessentially American tale that spans nearly a century. More than anyone else, he could appreciate how his story neatly divides into four balanced seasons. During the spring, our protagonist takes root on his family&#x2019;s spare midwestern farm. He alights as a young adult in a glamorous town by the Pacific, reaches prodigious heights of fame and glory in middle age, and derives warmth from relationships old and new that sustain him during a long, peaceful winter. Like so many great narratives, the accepted version, the one Wooden himself told, often diverged from fact, as the myth overtook the man. But when all the glorification is stripped away, the person at the center of our tale remains very much the same boy who was planted in the Indiana soil at the turn of the twentieth century. All those friends, interviewers, players, and strangers who came to that den the way I did, we all wanted to know the same thing: <i>How did you do it?</i> He could never make the answer clear enough, perhaps because it was too simple for a complicated time. Everyone wanted the old man&#x2019;s secrets, but he had no secrets, only seeds. For all the things that John Wooden accomplished&#x2014;as a player, a coach, and most of all, a teacher&#x2014;he never forgot his roots, or the man who planted them.</p> <p>Part One</p> <p>Spring</p> <p>1</p> <p>Hugh</p> <p>John Robert Wooden enjoyed unparalleled success as a college basketball coach, and after he retired he built a veritable industry around his own personal definition of <i>success</i>. Yet the most lasting impression his father made on John was the manner in which he responded to a failure.</p> <p>It happened in the summer of 1925, when John was fourteen years old. John, his parents, and his three brothers were living in the tiny town of Centerton, Indiana, on a sixty-acre farm they had inherited from the parents of John Wooden&#x2019;s mother, Roxie Anna. They grew wheat, corn, alfalfa, potatoes, watermelons, tomatoes, and timothy grass, which was used to feed cattle and horses. The town had few amenities&#x2014;a water tower, a general store, a grade school&#x2014;and the Woodens&#x2019; life was not easy. But they never wanted for anything, so long as they were willing to work for it.</p> <p>If they needed bread, Roxie baked it. If they wanted butter, Hugh churned it. If they needed water, they hand-pumped it from a well. When winter came and the kids got cold, their parents would heat up bricks on the stove and wrap them in warm towels. If they wanted to relieve themselves, they used the three-hole outhouse in the backyard. The family got eggs from their chickens and milk from their cows. They started off every morning with a hearty bowl of oatmeal. The house had just two bedrooms, so the brothers slept two to a bed. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t have much money,&#x201d; Billy Wooden said. &#x201c;Father worked for a dollar a day in the twenties, but ours was a happy family. We were always having company.&#x201d;</p> <p>The setback came shortly after Hugh purchased about thirty hogs from a local farmer. Hogs were expensive, so he had to borrow money from a bank and put up his house as collateral. Hugh needed to inoculate the animals against cholera, but the vaccination serum he purchased turned out to be defective. All the hogs died. That, coupled with an untimely drought that killed off most of their crops, prompted the bank to foreclose on the farm. Just like that, Hugh Wooden&#x2019;s sole means for supporting his family was gone.</p> <p>One of the handwritten lessons that Hugh passed to his four sons was what he called his &#x201c;Two Sets of Threes&#x201d;: <i>Never lie, never cheat, never steal. Don&#x2019;t whine, don&#x2019;t complain, don&#x2019;t make excuses.</i> Here was the chance to walk what he talked. &#x201c;Through it all, Dad never winced. He laid no blame on the merchant who had sold him the bad serum, didn&#x2019;t curse the weather, and had no hatred toward the banker,&#x201d; John would write decades later. &#x201c;As instructive as it was to hear him recite the two sets of threes, seeing him abide by them as he lost the farm had a most powerful effect on me. That&#x2019;s where I came to see that what you do is more important than what you say you&#x2019;ll do.&#x201d;</p> <p>Hugh&#x2019;s response was emblematic of the world in which John Wooden was raised. This was Depression-era Indiana, a time and place that valued masculine self-sufficiency. Feelings were demonstrated, not articulated. If Hugh ever embraced his sons or told them &#x201c;I love you,&#x201d; John rarely spoke or wrote of it. Likewise, Wooden&#x2019;s parents were not physically affectionate with each other in front of their children. Johnny knew they were in love by the way they treated each other. They had married young&#x2014;Hugh was twenty, Roxie was sixteen. John was their third child, born October 14, 1910, in Martinsville. (For most of his life, John claimed the town of Hall, Indiana, as his birthplace, but shortly before he died, a group of local researchers discovered he had been mistaken all those years.) When Johnny was born, Hugh was working as a buttermaker at a creamery in Martinsville. Three years later, the family moved to Hall, thirteen miles away, where Hugh worked on a small farm owned by a man named Cassius Ludlow. From there they moved to Monrovia, where he took a position as a rural mail carrier. Some of Johnny&#x2019;s favorite childhood memories involved riding with his dad on his horse-drawn carriage and helping him wash the buggy in a stream until it sparkled. When Johnny was six years old, his maternal grandfather passed away, leaving to his daughter the farm in Centerton. After the family lost that farm, nine years later they moved back to Martinsville, where Hugh and Roxie stayed for good.</p> <p>By that time, the family had endured hardship far more painful than losing the farm. Johnny&#x2019;s older sister, Cordelia, died of diphtheria on January 5, 1913, at the age of three years and nine months. &#x201c;Little Cordelia, as she was familiarly known, was a loving, bright and obedient child,&#x201d; read her obituary in the <i>Martinsville Democrat</i>. &#x201c;She was greatly loved by all who knew her. Her last sickness was of short duration. She was confined to her bed with diphtheria which developed into pneumonia and paralysis of the heart. Her suffering was great, although she bore it with the patience of a lamb, always ready to take her medicine and do as she was told. She leaves a loving father, mother, two dear little brothers, four grandparents, and a host of relatives and friends to mourn their loss.&#x201d;</p> <p>Three and a half months later, Roxie gave birth to another baby girl, who died during delivery. One can only imagine the wrenching anguish Roxie must have felt as she returned to the unremarkable cemetery in Centerton to bury her second daughter in four months. The plot would be marked with a gravestone that read, &#x201c;INFANT.&#x201d;</p> <p>The death of his sisters insured that John would grow up in a male-dominated household. In his later life, he wrote and spoke often about his father, but he seldom mentioned his mother. When he did, it was often in passing. &#x201c;I think the person probably who had the most influence on me throughout were my mother and father, particularly my father,&#x201d; he said in one of his typical locutions. If Hugh was omnipresent in John&#x2019;s life story, Roxie was the quiet, sad shadow in the background. She was the skilled seamstress who stitched socks to create makeshift basketballs for her sons. The diligent maid who handwashed their clothes, mopped their floors, cooked their meals. The poor gal who walked on feet that were deformed from all those years of wearing shoes that didn&#x2019;t fit. &#x201c;She was probably depressed,&#x201d; said Andy Hill, who played for Wooden at UCLA from 1970 to 1972 and became extremely close to him during the final decade of his life. &#x201c;But in those days they didn&#x2019;t call it that. You just sucked it up.&#x201d; Wooden&#x2019;s daughter, Nan, added, &#x201c;Daddy said her heart was broken.&#x201d;</p> <p>Though the family didn&#x2019;t have much money, Hugh would sometimes take Roxie into Martinsville and splurge for dinner at Riley&#x2019;s Cafï¿½. John often cited Hugh as an exemplar of the Reverend Theodore Hesburgh&#x2019;s credo that &#x201c;the best thing a man can do for his children is love their mother.&#x201d; But without any sisters around, Roxie was the only feminine presence in Johnny&#x2019;s life, and she was not a strong one. That caused him to be intensely shy around girls. &#x201c;John did not have an active social life as a kid,&#x201d; his younger brother, Danny, said. &#x201c;He was concentrating on his school work and working and being with his family.&#x201d;</p> <p>Hugh also embodied another of John&#x2019;s favorite credos: &#x201c;There is nothing stronger than gentleness.&#x201d; Exhibit A was Hugh&#x2019;s interactions with animals. The Woodens had two mules on their farm, Jack and Kate, but Hugh, who, John said, was strong enough to bend a thick iron bar with his bare hands, refused to whip them. John loved to tell the story of the day he and his father came upon a man who was trying to retrieve two horses from a gravel pit. &#x201c;The man was whipping them,&#x201d; John said. &#x201c;My dad said, &#x2018;Let me take them.&#x2019; The horses were frothing at the mouth. My dad just said to them, &#x2018;Get on your feet; let&#x2019;s go.&#x2019; He gave one of the horses a light tap and then pulled them together. Somehow I never forgot that.&#x201d; John said his father had the same effect on other animals. &#x201c;Dogs that would scare me, he&#x2019;d pet &#x2019;em and they would wag their tails.&#x201d;</p> <p>There was, however, one incident where Hugh was not so gentle. Johnny and his older brother, Maurice had been fooling around in a barn when Maurice grabbed a pitchfork and flipped a pile of manure at Johnny&#x2019;s face. Johnny lunged at Maurice in anger and cursed at him. Hugh had been standing nearby, but instead of reproaching Maurice for instigating the fight, he came down on Johnny for his ...</p></p><h2>1001 Gardens You Must See Before You Die</h2><p>Garden lovers and discriminating travelers will relish this armchair tour of the most beautiful and interesting gardens around the world.

Weidensaul's theme is change as he traces the mountains' geological origins from the Ice Ages through the incredible diversity and richness of pre-Columbian and Colonial days on up to the modern era. In some respects, the Appalachians are healthier now than during the height of mining and deforestation early in this century. Many animal poulations are rebounding, including the black bear in Pennsylvania. However, new pressures-acid rain, development, alien species-threaten the forests. The strength of this book lies in the wonders Weidensaul finds in this familiar wilderness-in the lives of darters and mussels and the mystery of the forest bison.

The Beach Boys, from their California roots to their international fame, are a unique American story -- one of overnight success and age-defying longevity; of musical genius and reckless self-destruction; of spirituality, betrayal, and forgiveness -- and Love is the only band member to be part of it each and every step. His own story has never been fully told, of how a sheet-metal apprentice became the quintessential front man for America's most successful rock band, singing in more than 5,600 concerts in 26 countries.<br><br>Love describes the stories behind his lyrics for pop classics such as "Good Vibrations," "California Girls," "Surfin' USA," and "Kokomo," while providing vivid portraits of the turbulent lives of his three gifted cousins, Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson. His partnership with Brian has few equals in American pop music, though Mike has carved out a legacy of his own -- he co-wrote the lyrics to eleven of the twelve original Beach Boy songs that were top 10 hits while providing the lead vocals on ten of them. The band's unprecedented durability also provides a glimpse into America's changing cultural mores over the past half century, while Love himself has experienced both the diabolical and the divine -- from Charles Manson's "family" threatening his life to Maharishi instilling it with peace. A husband, a father, and an avid environmentalist, Love has written a book that is as rich and layered as the Beach Boy harmonies themselves.</p><p><b>Mike Love&nbsp;</b>is a founding member of the Beach Boys, who began in 1961 and stand as the most popular American group in history, with thirteen Gold albums, fifty-five Top 100 singles, and four No. 1 hits.

Provenï¿½al cookbooks and guidebooks entice with provocatively fresh salads and azure skies, but is it really all Cï¿½tes-du-Rhï¿½ne and fleur-de-lis? Author Peter Mayle answers that question with wit, warmth, and wicked candor in <i>A Year in Provence</i>, the chronicle of his own foray into Provenï¿½al domesticity. <p> Beginning, appropriately enough, on New Year's Day with a divine luncheon in a quaint restaurant, Mayle sets the scene and pits his British sensibilities against it. "We had talked about it during the long gray winters and the damp green summers," he writes, "looked with an addict's longing at photographs of village markets and vineyards, dreamed of being woken up by the sun slanting through the bedroom window." He describes in loving detail the charming, 200-year-old farmhouse at the base of the Lubï¿½ron Mountains, its thick stone walls and well-tended vines, its wine <i>cave</i> and wells, its shade trees and swimming pool--its lack of central heating. Indeed, not 10 pages into the book, reality comes crashing into conflict with the idyll when the Mistral, that frigid wind that ravages the Rhï¿½ne valley in winter, cracks the pipes, rips tiles from the roof, and tears a window from its hinges. And that's just January. </p><p> In prose that skips along lightly, Mayle records the highlights of each month, from the aberration of snow in February and the algae-filled swimming pool of March through the tourist invasions and unpredictable renovations of the summer months to a quiet Christmas alone. Throughout the book, he paints colorful portraits of his neighbors, the Provenï¿½aux grocers and butchers and farmers who amuse, confuse, and befuddle him at every turn. <i>A Year in Provence </i> is part memoir, part homeowner's manual, part travelogue, and all charming fun. <i>--L.A. Smith</i></p>They had been there often as tourists. They had cherished the dream of someday living all year under the Provencal sun. And suddenly it happened. <br>Here is the month-by-month account of the charms and frustrations that Peter Mayle and his wife -- and their two large dogs -- experience their first year in the remote country of the Luberon restoring a two-centuries-old stone farmhouse that they bought on sight. From coping in January with the first mistral, which comes howling down from the Rhone Valley and wreaks havoc with the pipes, to dealing as the months go by with the disarming promises and procrastination of the local masons and plumbers, Peter Mayle delights us with his strategies for survival. He relishes the growing camaraderie with his country neighbors -- despite the rich, soupy, often impenetrable patois that threatens to separate them. He makes friends with boar hunters and truffle hunters, a man who eats foxes, and another who bites dentists; he discovers the secrets of handicapping racing goats and of disarming vipers. And he comes to dread the onslaught of tourists who disrupt his tranquillity. <br>In this often hilarious, seductive book Peter Mayle manages to transport us info all the earthy pleasures of Provencal life and lets us live vicariously in a tempo governed by seasons, not by days. George Lang, who was smitten, suggests: "Get a glass of marc, lean back in your most comfortable chair, and spend a delicious year in Provence."</p><h2>Before Photography: Painting and the Invention of Photography</h2><p>Catalog for exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA, NYC) in 1981.

The genre truly flourished in the 1920s and, more somberly, in the exile from Nazi-dominated Germany of the 1930s. Roth left Germany in 1925 for France, where he seems to have felt more at home. Paris dazzled him, and it shows in his writing, but the reports from the provinces are even more spectacular. Roth is captivated by the light of the south and its heady ethnic mix, by the traces of history he finds in the cathedral of Avignon and the pulsing activity on the Marseilles docks. In Lyons he finds silk workers whose very souls reflect the "shiny, luminous, glowing threads" with which they work every day. Lively, happy France is Roth's foil for a Germany where there is no fun to be had and everyone thinks in categories. In Paris, eastern European Jews can live as they please, and no one pays much attention to French anti-Semites. Roth's observations were not always accurate, but no matter. It is his acute sense for sights, sounds and smells, his insightful intelligence and, most of all, his sparkling prose, captured so well by Michael Hofmann's English, that are important. This volume is an excellent companion to the compilation of Roth's Berlin dispatches, What I Saw, published by Norton last year. It is a joy to read, even when the events turn grim. 40 illus. not seen by PW. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Featuring extensive author commentary, <b>Dreamsongs, Volume II</b><i>; </i>is an invaluable chronicle of a writer at the height of his creativity&#x2014;and an unforgettable reading experience for fans old and new.</p><p>George R.R. Martin sold his first story in 1971 and has been writing professionally since then. He spent ten years in Hollywood as a writer-producer, working on <i>The Twilight Zone, Beauty and the Beast</i>, and various feature films and television pilots that were never made. In the mid '90s he returned to prose, his first love, and began work on his epic fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire. He has been in the Seven Kingdoms ever since. Whenever he's allowed to leave, he returns to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he lives with the lovely Parris, a big white dog called Mischa, and two cats named Augustus and Caligula, who think they run the place.<i>The Hedge Night<br><br>A Tale of the Seven Kingdoms</i><br>The spring rains had softened the ground, so Dunk had no trouble digging the grave. He chose a spot on the western slope of a low hill, for the old man had always loved to watch the sunset.<br><br>&#x201c;Another day done,&#x201d; he would sigh, &#x201c;and who knows what the morrow will bring us, eh, Dunk?&#x201d;<br><br>Well, one morrow had brought rains that soaked them to the bones, and the one after had brought wet gusty winds, and the next a chill. By the fourth day the old man was too weak to ride. And now he was gone. Only a few days past, he had been singing as they rode, the old song about going to Gulltown to see a fair maid, but instead of Gulltown he&#x2019;d sung of Ashford. <i>Off to Ashford to see the fair maid, heighho, heigh-ho, </i>Dunk thought miserably as he dug.<br><br>When the hole was deep enough, he lifted the old man&#x2019;s body in his arms and carried him there. He had been a small man, and slim; stripped of hauberk, helm, and sword belt, he seemed to weigh no more than a bag of leaves. Dunk was hugely tall for his age, a shambling, shaggy, bigboned boy of sixteen or seventeen years (no one was quite certain which) who stood closer to seven feet than to six, and had only just begun to fill out his frame. The old man had often praised his strength. He had always been generous in his praise. It was all he had to give.<br><br>He laid him out in the bottom of the grave and stood over him for a time. The smell of rain was in the air again, and he knew he ought to fill the hole before the rain broke, but it was hard to throw dirt down on that tired old face. <i>There ought to be a septon here, to say some prayers over him, but he only has me. </i>The old man had taught Dunk all he knew of swords and shields and lances, but had never been much good at teaching him words.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d leave your sword, but it would rust in the ground,&#x201d; he said at last, apologetic. &#x201c;The gods will give you a new one, I guess. I wish you didn&#x2019;t die, ser.&#x201d; He paused, uncertain what else needed to be said. He didn&#x2019;t know any prayers, not all the way through; the old man had never been much for praying. &#x201c;You were a true knight, and you never beat me when I didn&#x2019;t deserve it,&#x201d; he finally managed, &#x201c;except that one time in Maidenpool. It was the inn boy who ate the widow woman&#x2019;s pie, not me, I told you. It don&#x2019;t matter now. The gods keep you, ser.&#x201d;<br><br>He kicked dirt in the hole, then began to fill it methodically, never looking at the thing at the bottom. <i>He had a long life, </i>Dunk thought. <i>He must have been closer to sixty than to fifty, and how many men can say that? </i>At least he had lived to see another spring.<br><br>The sun was westering as he fed the horses. There were three; his swaybacked stot, the old man&#x2019;s palfrey, and Thunder, his warhorse, who was ridden only in tourney and battle. The big brown stallion was not as swift or strong as he had once been, but he still had his bright eye and fierce spirit, and he was more valuable than everything else Dunk owned.<br><i><br>If I sold Thunder and old Chestnut, and the saddles and bridles too, I&#x2019;d come away with enough silver to... </i>Dunk frowned. The only life he knew was the life of a hedge knight, riding from keep to keep, taking service with this lord and that lord, fighting in their battles and eating in their halls until the war was done, then moving on. There were tourneys from time to time as well, though less often, and he knew that some hedge knights turned robber during lean winters, though the old man never had.<br><i><br>I could find another hedge knight in need of a squire to tend his animals and clean his mail, </i>he thought, <i>or might be I could go to some city, to Lannisport or King&#x2019;s Landing, and join the City Watch. Or else . . .<br></i><br>He had piled the old man&#x2019;s things under an oak. The cloth purse contained three silver stags, nineteen copper pennies, and a chipped garnet; as with most hedge knights, the greatest part of his worldly wealth had been tied up in his horses and weapons. Dunk now owned a chain-mail hauberk that he had scoured the rust off a thousand times.<br><br>An iron halfhelm with a broad nasal and a dent on the left temple. A sword belt of cracked brown leather, and a longsword in a wood-andleather scabbard. A dagger, a razor, a whetstone. Greaves and gorget, an eight-foot war lance of turned ash topped by a cruel iron point, and anm oaken shield with a scarred metal rim, bearing the sigil of Ser Arlan of Pennytree: a winged chalice, silver on brown.<br><br>Dunk looked at the shield, scooped up the sword belt, and looked at the shield again. The belt was made for the old man&#x2019;s skinny hips. It would never do for him, no more than the hauberk would. He tied the scabbard to a length of hempen rope, knotted it around his waist, and drew the longsword.<br><br>The blade was straight and heavy, good castle-forged steel, the grip soft leather wrapped over wood, the pommel a smooth polished black stone. Plain as it was, the sword felt good in his hand, and Dunk knew how sharp it was, having worked it with whetstone and oilcloth many a night before they went to sleep. <i>It fits my grip as well as it ever fit his, </i>he thought to himself, <i>and there is a tourney at Ashford Meadow.<br></i>Sweetfoot had an easier gait than old Chestnut, but Dunk was still sore and tired when he spied the inn ahead, a tall daub-andtimber building beside a stream. The warm yellow light spilling from its windows looked so inviting that he could not pass it by. <i>I have three silvers, </i>he told himself, <i>enough for a good meal and as much ale as I care to drink.<br></i><br>As he dismounted, a naked boy emerged dripping from the stream and began to dry himself on a roughspun brown cloak. <br><br>&#x201c;Are you the stableboy?&#x201d;<br><br>Dunk asked him. The lad looked to be no more than eight or nine, a pasty-faced skinny thing, his bare feet caked in mud up to the ankle.<br><br>His hair was the queerest thing about him. He had none. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll want my palfrey rubbed down. And oats for all three. Can you tend to them?&#x201d;<br><br>The boy looked at him brazenly. &#x201c;I could. If I wanted.&#x201d;<br><br>Dunk frowned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have none of that. I am a knight, I&#x2019;ll have you know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t look to be a knight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do all knights look the same?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, but they don&#x2019;t look like you, either. Your sword belt&#x2019;s made of rope.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So long as it holds my scabbard, it serves. Now see to my horses.<br><br>You&#x2019;ll get a copper if you do well, and a clout in the ear if you don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>He did not wait to see how the stableboy took that, but turned away and shouldered through the door.<br><br>At this hour, he would have expected the inn to be crowded, but the common room was almost empty. A young lordling in a fine damask mantle was passed out at one table, snoring softly into a pool of spilled wine. Otherwise there was no one. Dunk looked around uncertainly until a stout, short, whey-faced woman emerged from the kitchens and said, &#x201c;Sit where you like. Is it ale you want, or food?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Both.&#x201d; Dunk took a chair by the window, well away from the sleeping man.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s good lamb, roasted with a crust of herbs, and some ducks my son shot down. Which will you have?&#x201d;<br><br>He had not eaten at an inn in half a year or more. &#x201c;Both.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman laughed. &#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;re big enough for it.&#x201d; She drew a tankard of ale and brought it to his table. <br><br>&#x201c;Will you be wanting a room for the night as well?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Dunk would have liked nothing better than a soft straw mattress and a roof above his head, but he needed to be careful with his coin. The ground would serve. &#x201c;Some food, some ale, and it&#x2019;s on to Ashford for me. How much farther is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A day&#x2019;s ride. Bear north when the road forks at the burned mill. Is my boy seeing to your horses, or has he run off again?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, he&#x2019;s there,&#x201d; said Dunk. &#x201c;You seem to have no custom.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Half the town&#x2019;s gone to see the tourney.My own would as well, if I allowed it. They&#x2019;ll have this inn when I go, but the boy would sooner swagger about with soldiers, and the girl turns to sighs and giggles every time a knight rides by. I swear I couldn&#x2019;t tell you why. Knights are built the same as other men, and I never knew a joust to change the price of eggs.&#x201d; She eyed Dunk curiously; his sword and shield told her one thing, his rope belt and roughspun tunic quite another. <br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re bound for the tourney yourself?&#x201d;<br><br>He took a sip of the ale before he answered. A nut-brown color it was, and thick on the tongue, the way he liked it. <br><br>&#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I mean to be a champion.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you, now?&#x201d; the innkeep answered, polite enough.<br><br>Across the room, the lordling raised his head from the wine puddle.<br><br>His face had a sallow, unhealthy cast to it beneath a rat&#x2019;s nest of sandy brown hair, and blond stubble crusted his chin. He rubbed his mouth, blinked at Dunk, and said, &#x201c;I dreamed of you.&#x201d; His hand trembled as he pointed a finger. &#x201c;You stay away from me, do you hear? You stay well away.&#x201d;<br><br>Dunk stared at him uncertainly. &#x201c;My lord?&#x201d;<br><br>The innkeep leaned close. &#x201c;Never you mind that one, ser. All he does is drink and talk about his dreams. I&#x2019;ll see about that food.&#x201d; She bustled off.<br><br>&#x201c;Food?&#x201d; The lordling made the word an obscenity. He staggered to his feet, one hand on the table to keep himself from falling. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to be sick,&#x201d; he announced. The front of his tunic was crusty-red with old wine stains. &#x201c;I wanted a whore, but there&#x2019;s none to be found here.<br><br>All gone to Ashford Meadow. Gods be good, I need some wine.&#x201d; <br><br>He lurched unsteadily from the common room, and Dunk heard him climbing steps, singing under his breath.<br><i><br>A sad creature, </i>thought Dunk. <i>But why did he think he knew me? </i>He pondered that a moment over his ale.<br><br>The lamb was as good as any he had ever eaten, and the duck was even better, cooked with cherries and lemons and not near as greasy as most. The innkeep brought buttered pease as well, and oaten bread still hot from her oven. <i>This is what it means to be a knight, </i>he told himself as he sucked the last bit of meat off the bone. <i>Good food, and ale whenever I want it, and no one to clout me in the head. </i>He had a second tankard of ale with the meal, a third to wash it down, and a fourth because there was no one to tell him he couldn&#x2019;t, and when he was done he paid the woman with a silver stag and still got back a fistful of coppers. It was full dark by the time Dunk emerged. His stomach was full and his purse was a little lighter, but he felt good as he walked to the stables. Ahead, he heard a horse whicker. &#x201c;Easy, lad,&#x201d; a boy&#x2019;s voice said.<br><br>Dunk quickened his step, frowning.<br><br>He found the stableboy mounted on Thunder and wearing the old man&#x2019;s armor. The hauberk was longer than he was, and he&#x2019;d had to tilt the helm back on his bald head or else it would have covered his eyes.<br><br>He looked utterly intent, and utterly absurd. Dunk stopped in the stable door and laughed.<br><br>The boy looked up, flushed, vaulted to the ground. &#x201c;My lord, I did not mean&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thief,&#x201d; Dunk said, trying to sound stern. &#x201c;Take off that armor, and be glad that Thunder didn&#x2019;t kick you in that fool head. He&#x2019;s a warhorse, not a boy&#x2019;s pony.&#x201d;<br><br>The boy took off the helm and flung it to the straw. &#x201c;I could ride him as well as you,&#x201d; he said, bold as you please.<br><br>&#x201c;Close your mouth, I want none of your insolence. The hauberk too, take it off. What did you think you were doing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How can I tell you, with my mouth closed?&#x201d; The boy squirmed out of the chain mail and let it fall.<br><br>&#x201c;You can open your mouth to answer,&#x201d; said Dunk. &#x201c;Now pick up that mail, shake off the dirt, and put it back where you found it. And the halfhelm too. Did you feed the horses, as I told you? And rub down Sweetfoot?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; the boy said, as he shook straw from the mail. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to Ashford, aren&#x2019;t you? Take me with you, ser.&#x201d;<br><br>The innkeep had warned him of this. &#x201c;And what might your mother say to that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My mother?&#x201d; The boy wrinkled up his face. &#x201c;My mother&#x2019;s dead, she wouldn&#x2019;t say anything.&#x201d;<br><br>He was surprised. Wasn&#x2019;t the innkeep his mother? Perhaps he was only &#x2019;prenticed to her. Dunk&#x2019;s head was a little fuzzy from the ale. &#x201c;Are you an orphan boy?&#x201d; he asked uncertainly.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you?&#x201d; the boy threw back.<br><br>&#x201c;I was once,&#x201d; Dunk admitted. <i>Till the old man took me in.<br></i><br>&#x201c;If you took me, I could squire for you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have no need of a squire,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Every knight needs a squire,&#x201d; the boy said. &#x201c;You look as though you need one more than most.&#x201d;<br><br>Dunk raised a hand threateningly. &#x201c;And you look as though you need a clout in the ear, it seems to me. Fill me a sack of oats. I&#x2019;m off for Ashford . . . alone.&#x201d;<br><br>If the boy was frightened, he hid it well. For a moment he stood there defiant, his arms crossed, but just as Dunk was about to give up on him the lad turned and went for the oats.<br><br>Dunk was relieved. <i>A pity I couldn&#x2019;t . . . but he has a good life here at the inn, a better one than he&#x2019;d have squiring for a hedge knight.Taking him would be no kindness.<br></i><br>He could still feel the lad&#x2019;s disappointment, though. As he mounted Sweetfoot and took up Thunder&#x2019;s lead, Dunk decided that a copper penny might cheer him. &#x201c;Here, lad, for your help.&#x201d; He flipped the coin down at him with a smile, but the stableboy made no attempt to catch it. It fell in the dirt between his bare feet, and there he let it lie.<br><i><br>He&#x2019;ll scoop it up as soon as I am gone, </i>Dunk told himself. He turned the palfrey and rode from the inn, leading the other two horses. The trees were bright with moonlight, and the sky was cloudless and speckled with stars. Yet as he headed down the road he could feel the stableboy watching his back, sullen and silent.</p><h2>National Geographic Field Guide to the Trees of North America: The Essential Identification Guide for Novice and Expert</h2><p>Hardcover, Narrow Octavo, Pictorial Boards, 2006, PP.262, Color Illustrations, The Essential Identification Guide For Novice And expert</p><p></p><h2>Disney Princess Beginnings: Ariel Makes Waves (Disney Princess) (A Stepping Stone Book(TM))</h2><p><b>An all-new chapter book series featuring stories about each Disney Princess as a young girl!</b><br>Disney Princess Ariel and two of her sisters are swept out to sea by an enormous wave in this all-new story!

Known as the creator of disturbing demons and spectacular hellscapes, he also painted the Garden of Earthly Delights, where gleeful naked youths feast on giant strawberries. Little is known of Bosch&#39;s life and his art has remained enigmatic, variously interpreted as the hallucinations of a madman or the secret language of a heretical sect. The Surrealists claimed Bosch as a predecessor, seeing in his work the imagery of dream, fantasy and the subconscious. Laurinda Dixon argues, however, that to understand and appreciate Bosch&#39;s art, we must return to the era in which he lived.</p><p>Laurinda Dixon is Professor of Art History at Syracuse University, New York.

The successful Mississippi oilman's college affair with Mallory Candler ended long before she was killed, but the mysterious Eve knows things about that affair that only Mallory could have known. That's more than a coincidence, since Eve is actually Mallory's reincarnation&#x2014;or, at least, she's the corporeal body into which Mallory's restless soul seems to have migrated. Long before the bizarre denouement of this supernatural thriller--a departure for Iles, whose previous thrillers have been much more straightforward--the reader's sympathies have been engaged by Waters, a decent man whose best friend may be his worst enemy and whose past may destroy his future.

In her debut novel, Ashworth takes on a formidable task: an insane yet sympathetic protagonist whose efforts at self-help spell disaster. Annie Fairhurst is a socially inept and obese Briton who has murdered her husband and child&#x2014;which is alluded to but not confirmed until later in the story. She moves into a duplex occupied by an unmarried couple, Neil and Lucy, and Annie immediately becomes obsessed with Neil, who unfortunately makes the mistake of being friendly. In Annie's warped mind, Neil is sending her secret signals of love, although no rational human being would agree from the evidence presented. Annie clashes with Lucy from the start and as their relationship devolves, Annie's strange and aggressive behavior&#x2014;putting trash through Neil and Lucy's mail slot, stealing Lucy's dress, listening to Lucy and Neil's conversations through the shared wall of their duplex&#x2014;escalates from childish to, finally, criminal, in a shocking series of actions. Interspersed throughout are glimpses of Annie's past, her troubled marriage and stilted feelings toward her infant daughter, Grace. The beautiful, provocative prose and dangerous, quirky protagonist mark Ashworth as a writer to watch. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Founded in 1948 by Harry Snyder and his wife Esther in Baldwin Park, CA, In-N-Out Burger attracted a cult-like fanbase of cruising teens, surfers, and celebrities alike (who developed a secret shorthand for custom orders). As they expanded slowly over the years across California and into Nevada, Arizona, and Utah, they never sacrificed their core customer-service values and commitment to quality. Their made-to-order success story packs enough family drama to fuel an HBO miniseries. After Harry died in 1976, his son Rich took over the business (and was responsible for adding discreet Bible verses to In-N-Out cups and wrappers) until his death in a 1993 plane crash. His brother Guy, a drag-racing rebel with a dark side, stepped in to helm the business until his accidental overdose in 1999. If you've never had an In-N-Out burger, Perman's book just might inspire you to find a good reason to get yourself to Southern California and seek out an off-the-menu 3x3 with a side of Animal Style fries. <i>--Brad Thomas Parsons</i> <p> </p> <br><b>Author Stacy Perman's Guide to In-N-Out Burger's "Secret Menu"</b><br> Except for the addition of 7-Up and Dr. Pepper, In-N-Out Burger's menu has remained much as it was when the chain opened its first drive-thru in Baldwin Park, California in 1948. However, at some point in time, a "secret menu" emerged. Something of an insider's code, it is an off-menu series of variations on the chain's standard fare (Double-Double, hamburger, cheeseburger, and french fries) that has been passed on entirely by word-of-mouth through the years. <br><br> Although the "secret menu's" origins remain a mystery, part of its existence can be explained by the fact that In-N-Out Burger has always insisted on cooking-to-order each individual burger any way a customer wanted it prepared. Over time, several of these variations gained traction and somewhere along the way a number of them were given their own names. While frequently steeped in rumor and apocryphal tales the "secret menu" is almost always used by those In-N-Out customers in the know.<br><br> <b>These are the most popular "secret menu" items. In-N-Out Burger has listed them on their website (and even trademarked their names)</b>:<br> <b>Double Meat</b>: Two beef patties, lettuce, tomato, spread, (optional onions) on a toasted bun.<br> <b>3x3</b>: Three beef patties, lettuce, tomato, sauce, three slices of American cheese, (optional onions) on a toasted bun.<br> <b>4x4</b>: Four beef patties, lettuce, tomato, sauce, four slices of American cheese, (optional onions) on a toasted bun.<br> <b>Grilled Cheese</b>: Two slices of melted American cheese, lettuce, tomato, sauce, (optional onions) on a toasted bun.<br> <b>Protein Style</b>: Any burger served sans bun and wrapped in lettuce.<br> <b>Animal Style</b>: Any burger with mustard cooked beef, lettuce, tomato, extra sauce, pickle, and grilled onions on a toasted bun. (Note: the Grilled Cheese can also be prepared Animal Style)<br><br> <b>A few more "secret" variations that have made the rounds for those in the know</b>:<br> <b>X x Y</b>: Any number of beef patties with corresponding slices of American cheese (note on one memorable Halloween evening in Las Vegas a group of friends famously ordered and consumed a 100x100).<br> <b>Flying Dutchman</b>: beef patty or patties and American cheese slice(s) no vegetables or bun.<br> <b>Veggie Burger</b> (sometimes called a <b>Wish Burger</b>): no beef or cheese, just lettuce, tomato, or (optional) onions on a toasted bun.<br> <b>Extra Everything</b>: just like it sounds--extra sauce, tomato, lettuce, and onions served grilled or raw.<br> <b>Chopped Chilies</b>: mild chopped peppers are added to any burger. <br><br> <b>The "secret menu" also extends to a variety of french fry variations</b>:<br> <b>Animal Style Fries</b>: an order of fries slathered in melted American cheese, sauce, and grilled onions.<br> <b>Fries Light</b>: reduced cooking time resulting in softer, chewier french fries.<br> <b>Fries Well-Done</b>: increased cooking time resulting in crispier, browner french fries.<br> <b>Cheese Fries</b>: french fries bathed in melted American cheese.<br> <b>Onion Variations</b>:<br> The usual scenario is a whole slice of fresh onion cooked with the burger but In-N-Out will serve onions grilled, raw, and chopped if asked. <br><br> <b>For those really in the know</b>:<br> If you ask an associate at the counter they will give you a serving of yellow chili peppers.<br> Pickles are added only upon request. <br> <br><blockquote><p>The untold story of the renegade burger chain that evokes a passionate following unlike any other</p></blockquote><p>In fast-food corporate America, In-N-Out Burger stands apart. Begun in a tiny shack in the shadow of World War II, this family-owned chain has steadï¿½fastly refused to franchise or be sold. It is a testament to old-fashioned values and remï¿½iniscent of a simpler time when people, loyalty, and a freshly made, juicy hamburger meant something. Over time, In-N-Out Burger has become nothing less than a cultural instituï¿½tion that can lay claim to an insanely loyal following. </p><p>Perman uses her investigative skills to uncover the story of a real American success story. It is not only a tale of a unique and profitable business that exceeds all expectations, but of a family's struggle to maintain a sustainable pop empire against the industry it helped pioneer, internal tensions, and a bitter lawsuit that threatened to bring the company to the brink. </p><p>This is a lesson in a counterintuitive approach to doing business that places quality, customers, and employees over the riches promised by rapid expansion. <em>In-N-Out Burger</em> is a keenly observed narrative that explores the evolution of a California fad that transformed into an enduring cult of popularity; it is also the story of the conflicted, secretive, and ultimately tragic Snyder family who cooked a billion burgers and hooked a zillion fans. As the story of In-N-Out Burger unfolds, so too does the cultural history of America as influenced and shaped by car culture and fast food.</p></p><h2>And I Love You</h2><p>A classic story reimagined with fanciful brilliance<br><br>With comforting simplicity and gentle rhythms, Ruth Krauss celebrates the expansiveness of love between a parent and a child. In Steven Kellogg's luminous illustrations, a cat and her kitten discover the excitement and intimacy of sharing stories. As the pages turn and the landscapes evolve from forests to fields to sweeping ocean vistas, the tender bond that unites the cat and her kitten is deepened and enriched, making And I Love You an enchanting gift that will warm hearts both big and little.</p><p>RUTH KRAUSS (1911 1993) is the author of more than thirty books for children. Known for possessing keen insight into their thoughts and language, she has captivated young imaginations for generations with such classics as I&#x2019;ll Be You and You Be Me, Charlotte and the White Horse, and A Hole Is to Dig, all illustrated by Maurice Sendak, as well as the The Carrot Seed, illustrated by her husband, Crockett Johnson.<br><br>Steven Kellogg has illustrated more than a hundred books, including IS YOUR MAMA A LLAMA? and THE DAY JIMMY'S BOA ATE THE WASH. He has also retold and illustrated the adventures of tall-tale heroes such as Paul Bunyan, Mike Fink, and Johnny Appleseed. He lives in Essex, New York.PreS-Gr 2&#x2013;Krauss's simple text, originally published as Big and Little (Scholastic, 1987), is given a fresh look. Each spread suggests a big thing that loves something smaller. Most of the objects are familiar, like "Big forests love little trees" and "Big fields love little flowers." One exception is when Krauss states that "Big monkeys love little monkeyshines." Modern readers may wonder what "monkeyshines" are, and the illustration seems a little out of step with the rest of the book. The message of the whole, however, is clear and comforting: big people love and value youngsters. Kellogg illustrates the short text with perhaps his most artsy work yet. He uses translucent watercolor blues, greens, and yellows that suffuse the artwork with light. Starbursts, balloons, and butterflies fill the air around the main characters. The artist's recent use of textured surfaces in his painting, as in The Pied Piper's Magic (Dial, 2009), is here extended to a greater degree and the textures add dimension and interest to the pictures.<i>Donna Cardon, Provo City Library, UT</i><br>ï¿½ Copyright 2010.

The crosshatched bark paintings from Arnhem Land, the multi-layered &#34;dot&#34; paintings from central Australia, the ochre paintings of Western Australia&#39;s west Kimberley painters, the bright &#34;naif&#34; watercolours of the Fitzroy Crossing artists from the east Kimberley and the widely divergent individual expressions of urban artists are only some of the prolific expression of this rich, evolving tradition. But how has this art come about? What is the cultural wellspring from which it originates? Does &#34;traditional&#34; Aboriginal art still exist? How is the relationship between people and their land expressed in images? Why do some Aboriginal artists use only modern materials and others traditional media such as bark and ochre? And where and how is this art produced, displayed, marketed and sold? This book, heavily illustrated with examples of much of the finest Aboriginal art of the recent past, answers these and many other questions through its exploration of the vastly different Australian landscapes and the historic circumstances of the growth of this vibrant movement.</p><p>Susan McCulloch is The Australian&#39;s visual arts writer and the co-author (with her late father, the critic Alan McCulloch) of Australia&#39;s major art reference book The Encyclopedia of Australian Art. She has travelled extensively to the major art producing centres of Arnhem Land, the Central Desert and the Kimberley interviewing artists, art coordinators, dealers, collectors and curators.</p><h2>Delacroix</h2><p>At Delacroix&#39; studio sale, held six months after his death in 1864, crowds and critics were astonished at both the abundance and the multi-disciplinary nature of the work on display, the life&#39;s vision of a man praised by Baudelaire for being the last great artist of the Renaissance period and the first of the Modern. But Delacroix himself was well aware of the position he wanted to occupy. Taking his cue from Rubens in both lifestyle and visual inventiveness, he took the order of classical composition and allied it to a universally appreciated symbolic and allegorical intent, producing from that marriage works of unmatched integrity and sensuality. From the spectacular Salon reception in 1824 to a work such as the major Scenes from the Chios Massacre (when the term Romantique was first applied to his style) through to the liberating and controversial carnality of The Agony in the Garden, Delacroix&#39; genius in graphic design, in the liberation and reinvention of colour, and in the portrayal of bodies was never in doubt. His numerous sketchbooks attest to a personality committed to the most truthful results, in both his Goyaesque fantasias of horror, cruelty and sacrifice and in his huge historical canvases. Excessive, monumental, Byronic even, this Victor Hugo of the art world has proved profoundly influential, his technique studied by movements as diverse as Impressionism, Expressionism and the Abstract painters of mid-century. Leaving the self-indulgence of the Romantics far behind, the nobility of Delacroix&#39; spirit will continue to speak to any and every age.</p><p></p><h2>Poison Study (The Chronicles of Ixia, 1)</h2><p>Murder, mayhem and magic <br><br>Locked in a coffin-like darkness, there is nothing to distract me from my memories of killing Reyad.

Find her on the Web at MariaVSnyder.com.<br><br>Locked in darkness that surrounded me like a coffin, I had nothing to distract me from my memories. Vivid recollections waited to ambush me whenever my mind wandered.<br><br>Encompassed by the blackness, I remembered white-hot flames stabbing at my face. Though my hands had been tied to a post that dug sharply into my back, I had recoiled from the onslaught. The fire had pulled away just before blistering my skin, but my eyebrows and eyelashes had long since been singed off.<br><br>"Put the flames out!" a man's rough voice had ordered. I blew at the blaze through cracked lips. Dried by fire and fear, the moisture in my mouth had gone and my teeth radiated heat as if they had been baked in an oven.<br><br>"Idiot," he cursed. "Not with your mouth. Use your mind. Put the flames out with your mind."<br><br>Closing my eyes, I attempted to focus my thoughts on making the inferno disappear. I was willing to do anything, no matter how irrational, to persuade the man to stop.<br><br>"Try harder." Once again the heat swung near my face, the bright light blinding me in spite of my closed eyelids.<br><br>"Set her hair on fire," a different voice instructed. He sounded younger and more eager than the other man. "That should encourage her. Here, Father, let me."<br><br>My body jerked with intense fear as I recognized the voice. I twisted to loosen the bonds that held me as my thoughts scattered into a mindless buzzing. A droning noise had echoed from my throat and grew louder until it had pervaded the room and quenched the flames.<br><br>The loud metallic clank of the lock startled me from my nightmarish memory. A wedge of pale yellow light sliced the darkness, then traveled along the stone wall as the heavy cell door opened. Caught in the lantern's glow, my eyes were seared by the brightness. I squeezed them shut as I cowered in the corner.<br><br>"Move it, rat, or we'll get the whip!" Two dungeon guards attached a chain to the metal collar on my neck and hauled me to my feet. I stumbled forward, pain blazing around my throat. As I stood on trembling legs, the guards efficiently chained my hands behind me and manacled my feet.<br><br>I averted my eyes from the flickering light as they led me down the main corridor of the dungeon. Thick rancid air puffed in my face. My bare feet shuffled through puddles of unidentifiable muck.<br><br>Ignoring the calls and moans of the other prisoners, the guards never missed a step, but my heart lurched with every word.<br><br>"Ho, ho, ho...someone's gonna swing."<br><br>"Snap! Crack! Then your last meal slides down your legs!"<br><br>"One less rat to feed."<br><br>"Take me! Take me! I wanna die too!"<br><br>We stopped. Through squinted eyes I saw a staircase. In an effort to get my foot onto the first step, I tripped over the chains and fell. The guards dragged me up. The rough edges of the stone steps dug into my skin, peeling away exposed flesh on my arms and legs. After being pulled through two sets of thick metal doors, I was dumped onto the floor. Sunlight stabbed between my eyes. I shut them tight as tears spilled down my cheeks. It was the first time that I had seen daylight in seasons.<br><br><i>This is it, </i>I thought, starting to panic. But the knowledge that my execution would end my miserable existence in the dungeon calmed me.<br><br>Yanked to my feet again, I followed the guards blindly. My body itched from insect bites and from sleeping on dirty straw. I stunk of rat. Given only a small ration of water, I didn't waste it on baths.<br><br>Once my eyes adjusted to the light, I looked around. The walls were bare, without the fabled gold sconces and elaborate tapestries I had been told once decorated the castle's main hallways. The cold stone floor was worn smooth in the middle. We were probably traveling along the hidden corridors used solely by the servants and guards. As we passed two open windows, I glanced out with a hunger that no food could satisfy.<br><br>The bright emerald of the grass made my eyes ache. Trees wore cloaks of leaves. Flowers laced the footpaths and overflowed from barrels. The fresh breeze smelled like an expensive perfume, and I breathed deeply. After the acidic smells of excrement and body odor, the taste of the air was like drinking a fine wine. Warmth caressed my skin. A soothing touch compared to the constantly damp and chilly dungeon.<br><br>I guessed it was the beginning of the hot season, which meant that I had been locked in the cell for five seasons, one season shy of a full year. It seemed an excessively long time for someone scheduled for execution.<br><br>Winded from the effort of marching with my feet chained, I was led into a spacious office. Maps of the Territory of Ixia and the lands beyond covered the walls. Piles of books on the floor made walking a straight line difficult. Candles in various stages of use littered the room, singe marks evident on several papers that had gotten too close to the candle's flame. A large wooden table, strewn with documents and ringed by half a dozen chairs, occupied the center of the room. At the back of the office a man sat at a desk. Behind him a square window gaped open, permitting a breeze to blow through his shoulder-length hair.<br><br>I shuddered, causing the chains to clatter. From the whispered conversations between prison cells, I had determined that condemned prisoners were taken to an official to confess their crimes before being hanged.<br><br>Wearing black pants and a black shirt with two red diamonds stitched on the collar, the man at the desk wore the uniform of an adviser to the Commander. His pallid face held no expression. As his sapphire-blue eyes scanned me, they widened in surprise.<br><br>Suddenly conscious of my appearance, I glanced down at my tattered red prison gown and dirty bare feet roughened with yellow calluses. Dirt-streaked skin showed through the rips in the thin fabric. My long black hair hung in greasy clumps. Sweat-soaked, I swayed under the weight of the chains.<br><br>"A woman? The next prisoner to be executed is a woman?" His voice was icy. My body trembled on hearing the word <i>executed </i>aloud. The calm I'd established earlier fled me. I would have sunk sobbing to the floor if the guards weren't with me. The guards tormented anyone who showed any weakness.<br><br>The man tugged at the black ringlets of his hair. "I should have taken the time to reread your dossier." He shooed the guards away. "You're dismissed."<br><br>When they were gone, he motioned me to the chair in front of his desk. The chains clanged as I perched on the edge.<br><br>He opened a folder on his desk and scanned the pages. "Yelena, today may be your lucky day," he said.<br><br>I swallowed a sarcastic reply. An important lesson I had mastered during my dungeon stay was never to talk back. I bowed my head instead, avoiding eye contact.<br><br>The man was quiet for a while. "Well-behaved and respectful. You're starting to look like a good candidate."<br><br>Despite the clutter of the room, the desk was neat. In addition to my folder and some writing implements, the only other items on the desk were two small, black statues glittering with streaks of silver&#x2014;a set of panthers carved to lifelike perfection.<br><br>"You've been tried and found guilty of murdering General Brazell's only son, Reyad." He paused, stroking his temple with his fingers. "That explains why Brazell's here this week, and why he has been unusually interested in the execution schedule." The man spoke more to himself than to me.<br><br>Upon hearing Brazell's name, fear coiled in my stomach. I steadied myself with a reminder that I was soon to be out of his reach forever.<br><br>The Territory of Ixia's military had come to power only a generation ago, but the rule had produced strict laws called the Code of Behavior. During peacetime&#x2014;most of the time, strangely enough for the military&#x2014;proper conduct didn't allow the taking of a human life. If someone committed murder, the punishment was execution. Self-preservation or an accidental death were not considered acceptable excuses. Once found guilty, the murderer was sent to the Commander's dungeon to await a public hanging.<br><br>"I suppose you're going to protest the conviction. Say you were framed or you killed out of self-defense." He leaned back in his chair, waiting with a weary patience.<br><br>"No, sir," I whispered, all I could manage from unused vocal cords. "I killed him."<br><br>The man in black straightened in his chair, shooting me a hard look. Then he laughed aloud. "This may work out better than I'd planned. Yelena, I'm offering you a choice. You can either be executed, or you can be Commander Ambrose's new food taster. His last taster died recently, and we need to fill the position."<br><br>I gaped at him, my heart dancing. He had to be joking. He was probably amusing himself. Great way to get a laugh. Watch hope and joy shine on the prisoner's face, then smash it by sending the accused to the noose.<br><br>I played along. "A fool would refuse the job." My voice rasped louder this time.<br><br>"Well, it's a lifetime position. The training can be lethal. After all, how can you identify poisons in the Commander's food if you don't know what they taste like?" He tidied the papers in the folder.<br><br>"You'll get a room in the castle to sleep, but most of the day you'll be with the Commander. No days off. No husband or children. Some prisoners have chosen execution instead. At least then they know exactly when they're going to die, rather than guessing if it's going to come with the next bite." He clicked his teeth together, a feral grin on his face.<br><br>He was serious. My whole body shook. A chance to live! Service to the Commander was better than the dungeon and infinitely better than the noose. Questions raced through my mind: I'm a convicted killer, how can they trust me? What would prevent me from killing the Commander or escaping?<br><br>"Who tastes the Commander's food now?" I asked instead, afraid if I asked the other questions he'd realize his mistake and send me to the gallows.<br><br>"I do. So I'm anxious to find a replacement. Also the Code of Behavior states that someone whose life is forfeit must be offered the job."<br><br>No longer able to sit still, I stood and paced around the room, dragging my chains with me. The maps on the walls showed strategic military positions. Book titles dealt with security and spying techniques. The condition and amount of candles suggested someone who worked late into the night.<br><br>I looked back at the man in the adviser's uniform. He had to be Valek, the Commander's personal security chief and leader of the vast intelligence network for the Territory of Ixia.<br><br>"What shall I tell the executioner?" Valek asked.<br><br>"I am not a fool."<br><br>Valek snapped the folder closed. He walked to the door; his stride as graceful and light as a snow cat traversing thin ice. The guards waiting in the hall snapped to attention when the door opened. Valek spoke to them, and they nodded. One guard came toward me. I stared at him, going back to the dungeon had not been part of Valek's offer. Could I escape? I scanned the room. The guard spun me around and removed the manacles and chains that had been draped around me since I'd been arrested.<br><br>Raw bands of flesh circled my bloody wrists. I touched my neck, feeling skin where there used to be metal. My fingers came away sticky with blood. I groped for the chair. Being freed of the weight of the chains caused a strange sensation to sweep over me; I felt as if I were either going to float away or pass out. I inhaled until the faintness passed.<br><br>When I regained my composure, I noticed Valek now stood beside his desk pouring two drinks. An opened wooden cabinet revealed rows of odd-shaped bottles and multicolored jars stacked inside. Valek placed the bottle he was holding into the cabinet and locked the door.<br><br>"While we're waiting for Margg, I thought maybe you could use a drink." He handed me a tall pewter goblet filled with an amber liquid. Raising his own goblet, he made a toast. "To Yelena, our newest food taster. May you last longer than your predecessor."<br><br>My goblet stopped short of my lips.<br><br>"Relax," he said, "it's a standard toast."<br><br>I took a long swig. The smooth liquid burned slightly as it slid down my throat. For a moment, I thought my stomach was going to rebel. This was the first time I had taken something other than water. Then it settled.<br><br>Before I could question him as to what exactly had happened to the previous food taster, Valek asked me to identify the ingredients of the drink. Taking a smaller portion, I replied, "Peaches sweetened with honey."<br><br>"Good. Now take another sip. This time roll the liquid around your tongue before swallowing."<br><br>I complied and was surprised to taste a faint citrus flavor. "Orange?"<br><br>"That's right. Now gargle it."<br><br>"Gargle?" I asked. He nodded. Feeling foolish, I gargled the rest of my drink and almost spat it out. "Rotten oranges!"<br><br></p><h2>Pop-Up: Secret Treasures (A National Geographic Action Book)</h2><p>Five meticulously detailed pop-up spreads reveal the secrets of ancient Egypt, China, Italy, Mexico, and Colorado as young archaeologists explore King Tut&#39;s tomb, the burial of a Chinese emperior, the buried town of Pompeii, a Mayan city, and an Anasazi village.</p><p></p><h2>Secret Agent Grandma (Give Yourself Goosebumps, No. 16)</h2><p>In a story with several possible endings, readers are cast in the role of a young person who must save the world&#39;s coolest grandma from her alien kidnappers.

She is a certified marriage and family counselor, a Texas Tech graduate and writer-in-residence at West Texas A&amp;M University. She lives with her husband in Amarillo, Texas.Sent west by her father to escape a dangerous feud between two Irish families in Pittsburgh, Kara O'Riley arrives in Kansas City with little money and no one to turn to for help, so she applies for the first job she can find. Having been given one year to make the Texas ranch he recently inherited a success, Jonathan Catlin desperately needs someone to sort out all the paperwork involved, so he reluctantly hires Kara as a bookkeeper. What starts out as a business arrangement gradually becomes something much more personal once cold and distant Jonathan realizes he is falling in love with sweet Kara.

Kara, in particular, is an appealing blend of vulnerability and strength, and watching this plucky heroine discover her own sense of worth and find true love is just one of the joys of reading this exceptional romance. <i>John Charles</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

The menu was and remains extensive; with nine oyster appetizers, fifty-one seafood entrees, and forty vegetables (among them potatoes prepared sixteen ways), it defined French-Creole cuisine for decades. The kitchen is still the largest of any freestanding restaurant in New Orleans. Dining rooms throughout the complex range from the ï¿½loversï¿½ lookoutï¿½ on the mezzanine to small chambers for intimate, private dining. True to the nineteenth-century design, the restaurant today has a serpentine network of passageways through the various buildings.

Casbarian&nbsp;asked that I write my first, the&nbsp;<i><b>Arnaud's Restaurant Cookbook</b></i>, celebrating his grande dame of French Quarter restaurants. Not many people ever told him no, but in this case, Archie, a friend, gentleman and restaurateur,had no idea what furies he'd unleashed. In retrospect, he did know me well. The success of Arnaud's book with Katrina's push inspired me to create the Classic series, an idea developed 20 years before, and Pelican Publishing embraced the notion. I became a designer, writer and photographer, at times some better than others. Friends, both authors and photographers, freely passed along their knowledge and encouragement.<i><b>New Orleans Classic Desserts, Seafood, Appetizers and Gumbo</b></i>&nbsp;each followed quickly. Gourmet Magazine named Gumbos and Soups as a Cookbook-of-the Month, surprising for a small book.&nbsp;The series has been exported to 12 other cities, so far.

Archie, thank you for watching over me.<p>Arnaud's Restaurant Cookbook<br>By Kit Wohl</p><p>In a city known for its culinary excellence and abundance of fine restaurants, few establishments have achieved worldwide acclaim. Arnaud's stands as a monument to the enduring allure of classic Creole cuisine, as well as to the excitement of gustatory innovation.<br>This New Orleans restaurant is a leader of the culinary old guard and serves tradition today with a menu of classics with a thoroughly contemporary accent. Within its beautifully restored, historic walls, one can sample dishes created on the premises--succulent Oysters Bienville and Arnaud's famous remoulade sauce, to name only two.<br>Arnaud's lasting success can be attributed in part to the constancy of its owners. It has known only two families since its establishment in 1918, from the colorful founder, "Count" Arnaud Cazenave, to his equally flamboyant daughter Germaine Cazenave Wells, to her heir apparent, Archie A. Casbarian.<br>Like the founder and his daughter, Casbarian has infused the restaurant with tradition and flair and shepherded its growth as a magical place to savor the full experience of a meal. When Archie and Jane Casbarian acquired Arnaud's they embarked on an extraordinary adventure. "Tonight," wrote Casbarian in his inaugural menu on February 28, 1979, "marks the rebirth of a grand and noble restaurant and heralds a new era in the history of a world-famous establishment."<br>"Creole cooking is an exuberant, living cuisine," emphasizes proprietor Archie Casbarian. "It continuously evolves as we take advantage of Louisiana's rich bounty of fresh seafood, shellfish, produce and culinary talent."</p><p>(continued on back flap)</p><p><br>Back flap</p><p>(continued from front flap)</p><p>Casbarian is dedicated to the fundamentals of Arnaud's heritage, keeping one foot in the past and the other a step ahead. Menus burst with seasonal flavors and the fun that is the soul of New Orleans.<br>Here you will find Creole classics and Arnaud's favorites, from Oyster Soup to Trout Meuniï¿½re, each recipe carefully adapted for use in the home kitchen. These versions have been tested to reproduce their delicious flavor profiles, while appreciating the realities of most kitchens. Aficionados of the restaurant can savor a true taste of New Orleans.<br>Arnaud's Restaurant Cookbook contains more than 150 recipes ranging from Pompano en Croute and traditional Seafood Gumbo to many of the dishes for which Arnaud's has always been renowned. Liberally sprinkled throughout are fascinating stories about the restaurant's history, the legends that shaped it, and, of course, the many celebrities who have dined there. It is liberally illustrated with photographs, cartoons, drawings, and other Arnaud's memorabilia.<br>To read and use Arnaud's Restaurant Cookbook is to participate in a feast for all the senses, nearly as seductive as a meal at Arnaud's itself.<br>Arnaud Cazenave (1876-1948) expressed his philosophy of dining this way:</p><p>When choosing a New Orleans Restaurant--a dinner chosen according to one's needs, tastes and moods, well prepared and well served, is a joy to all senses and an impelling incentive to sound sleep, good health and long life. Therefore, at least once a day, preferably in the cool and quiet of the evening, one should throw all care to the winds, relax completely and dine leisurely and well. Au revoir, mes amis! Je vais vivre at diner en sage.</p><p>Author Kit Wohl lives in New Orleans.

The Yazee gang was riding down upon us, six abreast. We all ran outside and confirmed that fact. The sensible thing would have been to run and hide -- but did we? Not at all.</i> <br> <br> The narrator of Larry McMurtry's newest book is spunky Nellie Courtright, twenty-two years old and already wrapping every man in the West around her little finger. When she and her teenage brother Jackson are orphaned, she sweet-talks the local sheriff into hiring Jackson as a deputy, while she takes over the vacant job of town telegrapher. When, by pure blind luck, Jackson shoots down the entire Yazee gang, Nellie is quick to capitalize on his new notoriety by selling reviews to reporters. It seems wherever Nellie is, action is sure to happen, from a love affair with Buffalo Bill to a ringside seat at the O.K. Corral gunfight. Told with charm, humor, and an unparalleled zest for life, Nellie's story is the story of how the West was won.</p><p>Larry McMurtry is the author of twenty-nine novels, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, three memoirs, two collections of essays, and more than thirty screenplays. He lives in Archer City, Texas.McMurtry fondly, if not originally, evokes the post-Civil War West in this loosely organized story told by spunky Nellie Courtright. Brought to life by actress Annie Potts, Nellie tells how she and her brother seek their fortune on their own after the suicide of their father. With all the appeal of a tall tale, the story intersperses a quirky cast of fictional characters with such historical figures as Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill Hickok, the Earp brothers, Doc Holliday, and Billy the Kid. Potts flawlessly narrates as though recounting her personal experience, using an understated Western accent that balances McMurtry's characteristic humor and exaggeration. This is an enjoyable example of an audiobook improving on its print version. S.K.

But long before they sight that mighty continent, Robyn knows that she and Mungo will battle with all the fury of natural enemies -- and love with all the desperation of those unable to evade the commands of fate.

He was educated at Michaelhouse and Rhodes University. He became a full-time writer in 1964 after the successful publication of When the Lion Feeds, and has since written over thirty novels, all meticulously researched on his numerous expeditions worldwide.

Oates has chosen twenty-seven of her early stories, many of them <em>O. Henry Award</em> and/or <em>Best American Short Story</em> selections, for this volume, the only collection of her early stories available.</p><p>Joyce Carol Oates is one of our most important and well known writers&#x2014;and one of America&#x2019;s foremost writers of the short story form. She is also a regular contributor of reviews and criticism for the New York Times Book Review, The New York Review of Books, and elsewhere. She also reads and lectures widely throughout the US, at universities and bookstores.In her 17th collection of short fiction, Oates ( With Shuddering Fall ) retrieves stories from her first six, as well as two stories not previously published in book form. And while the volume includes some of her best-known work ("Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?"), the chance to savor "The Molesters," never reprinted before though eventually included in her novel, Expensive People , and "How I Contemplated the World from the Detroit House of Correction and Began My Life Over Again" is momentous. For in stories such as these, the writer shows early signs of the sinister ingenuity and command of psychological nuance later fulfilled in other ways in other books. The new collection of work, dating from the 1960s and 1970s, reveals a consistency of theme. Oates demonstrates, for instance, that she was, as she is, cool-tempered yet seductive in her canny portrayals of innocence on the verge of defilement--and afterwards.

But as Daniel Boyarin writes, diaspora may be more constructively construed as a form of cultural hybridity or a mode of analysis. In <i>A Traveling Homeland,</i> he makes the case that a shared homeland or past and traumatic dissociation are not necessary conditions for diaspora and that Jews carry their homeland with them in diaspora, in the form of textual, interpretive communities built around talmudic study.</p><p>For Boyarin, the Babylonian Talmud is a diasporist manifesto, a text that produces and defines the practices that constitute Jewish diasporic identity. Boyarin examines the ways the Babylonian Talmud imagines its own community and sense of homeland, and he shows how talmudic commentaries from the medieval and early modern periods also produce a doubled cultural identity. He links the ongoing productivity of this bifocal cultural vision to the nature of the book: as the physical text moved between different times and places, the methods of its study developed through contact with surrounding cultures. Ultimately, <i>A Traveling Homeland</i> envisions talmudic study as the center of a shared Jewish identity and a distinctive feature of the Jewish diaspora that defines it as a thing apart from other cultural migrations.</p></p><p>Daniel Boyarin is Hermann P. and Sophia Taubman Professor of Talmudic Culture, Departments of Near Eastern Studies and Rhetoric, University of California, Berkeley. He is author of many books, including Border Lines: The Partition of Judaeo-Christianity, also available from the University of Pennsylvania Press.<p>Prelude<br>A Different Diaspora</p><p>"What is there worth saving and holding on to between the extremes of exile on the one hand, and the often bloody-minded affirmations of nationalism on the other?" Daniel Boyarin answers, of course: Diaspora."</p><p>From the <i>Chabad</i> [Hassidic group] <i>Journal</i>, May 7, 2013:</p><blockquote>Editor's Note:<p></p><p>Dear Friend,</p><p>Jerusalem is never far from our minds. After all, it is there that creation began, and it has been the center of our national devotion for 3,000 years. Three times a day, we face Jerusalem as we pray for the return of Gd's presence to His holy city.</p><p>Over 150 years ago, there was a pious and devoted Jew who desired to apply himself to Torah study and prayer in the Holy Land. When he shared his plan with his rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Lubavitch, he was taken aback by the rebbe's response, "Make Israel here." He did not need to go to Israel; rather, he was to bring Israel where he lived.</p><p>Every time we do another mitzvah, we port a bit of Jerusalem to wherever we are. And when the word is full of such mini-Jerusalems, we will all gather in our homeland&#x2014;for real.</p><p>Menachem Posner,<br>on behalf of the Chabad.org Editorial Team</p></blockquote>Khachig Tï¿½lï¿½lyan has written beautifully of what it is that makes a diaspora:<blockquote>The diasporist project, as C. L. R. James understood, is to enhance the articulations between the past and present, homeland and hostland segments of the transnation. . . . Without such connections&#x2014;however sporadic and discontinuous they may be in arduous practice&#x2014;to claim that the individual diasporan is a member of the diaspora and that the diasporic segment is a part of the homeland people (which can consist of the descendants of shared ancestors from three or ten generations ago) risks mere biologism. This pitfall can be juxtaposed with the mere psychologism that regards diaspora to be the figure of boundary-crossing multiplicity and links a specific individual to that diaspora by virtue of the multiplicity they share and&#x2014;again&#x2014;of birth. A diaspora is never merely an accident of birth, a clump of individuals living outside their ancestral homeland, each with a hybrid subjectivity, lacking collective practices that underscore (not just) their difference from others, but also their similarity to each other, and their links to the people on the homeland. Without some such minimum stringency of definition, most of America&#x2014;or Argentina, or New Zealand, or any modern immigrant-nation&#x2014;would just as easily be a diaspora. Perhaps diasporists should and must aspire to teach every nation, especially those created by immigration, to see and honor the diasporas within, to transform their/our self-perception and self-representation. But if we wish to remake the nations of the world in the image of the diaspora, we will not do it by fiats of redefinition, one person at a time.</blockquote>Revisioning "Diaspora"<p></p><p>Despite the correct observation just cited from Tï¿½lï¿½lyan, redefining things can sometimes be the beginning of a new political vision, so let us begin. Generally, the term "diaspora" with respect to Jews is used in one of three acceptations, which are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>It can appear in a kind of timeless geographical sense: the Jews who do not dwell in Palestine, whatever their historical conditions, So, for instance, all the thriving communities of Jews throughout the Ottoman Empire and beyond would be called the Diaspora, in contrast to a small, if vital, community of refugee Jews from Spain who have landed in Palestine in the sixteenth century, simply owing to geographical location. Second, it can appear in a chronological sense, the Diaspora being understood as a one-time event of scattering from the "homeland." Third, in a lachrymose sense, it can be the condition of being an oppressed minority longing to go "home."</p><p>Thus, for instance, in discussing the broadening of the usage of "diaspora" to refer to Africans, Armenians, and Irish, Robin Cohen writes: "With the Jews, these peoples conceived their scattering as arising from a cataclysmic event that had traumatized the group as a whole, thereby creating the central historical experience of victimhood at the hands of a cruel oppressor." Cohen, to be sure, complicates this as a controlling definition for diaspora <i>tout court</i> but leaves it essentially in place as an adequate description of the situation of the Jews, and that is precisely where the current intervention takes place.</p><p>I am proposing a very different approach to the question of diaspora: namely, diaspora as a particular kind of cultural hybridity and as a mode of analysis rather than as an essential thing. As shown by the analysis of the narrative of the four captives, with which I begin Chapter 1, diaspora is most usefully mobilized as a synchronic condition by which human groups are related to one another in space; they may, and frequently do, have an origin in an actually shared past but need not and, moreover, need not even have a story of such a shared&#x2014;traumatic&#x2014;past.</p><p>Cohen allows for such a component, writing that "diasporas often <i>mobilize a collective identity</i>, not only a place of settlement or only in respect of an imagined, putative or real homeland but also <i>in solidarity with coethnic members in other countries</i>. Bonds of language, religion, culture and a sense of a common fate impregnate such a transnational relationship and give to it an affective, intimate quality that formal citizenship or long settlement frequently lack. A useful description of this sentiment is 'coresponsibility.'" I am inclined to agree with Cohen, while taking much more seriously than he does the element of shared culture; but I would promote this from a marginal to an essential aspect of the description of a diaspora. Cohen further writes that "in some limited circumstances the term <i>'diaspora' can be used to describe transnational bonds of coresponsibility even where historically exclusive territorial claims are not strongly articulated</i>."</p><p>In the present book, I claim that this is not only a better way of describing the historical experiences of the Jews (of some Jews and not at all marginal ones) but has to be a defining feature of diaspora as a taxon to distinguish that term from others&#x2014;migration, exile, displacement&#x2014;with which it is frequently conflated. As Cohen notes, there have been various challenges to the notion of diaspora, owing to its putative association with notions of "origin" and "homeland," on the one hand; and on the other, because "in this formulation [diaspora], the primary orientation and attachment of diasporic populations is to their homelands and cultures." The point of the current argument is to displace these notions of diaspora, retaining its value and utility for describing particular kinds of cultural practice and solidarity without disputing the existence of others.</p><p>Once this is said, a homeland, real or even imagined, is not a necessary or sufficient condition for the existence of a diaspora. In the history of a given collective, there can be multiple diasporas, from Babylonia, Bari and Otranto, Spain, and the Rhineland&#x2014;shifting homelands, and even diaspora in which homeland is entirely absent and replaced by cultural connection. While trauma is frequently a point of origin or concomitant of diasporic existence, trauma is neither necessary nor sufficient to constitute a diaspora. Robin Cohen writes: "While the increased complexity and deterritorialization of identities are valid phenomena and constitutive of a small minority of diasporas (generally those that had been doubly or multiply displaced over time), ideas of home and often the stronger inflection of homeland remain powerful discourses." Not so minor, perhaps, as Cohen imagines; what I want to show is that crucial moments of Jewish historical experience fit this "minority" description much better than traditional ways of conceiving the Jewish diaspora.</p><p>Introducing the Argument</p><p>This book begins with an idea that is not new: that in some deep sense, a book has been the portable homeland of the Jewish people. The title of the book recalls Heine, who may have been the first to deploy this topos. More recent writers who have reflected it include George Steiner, Simon Schama, and my own departed teacher, Prof. Hayyim Zalman Dimitrovsky. What I try to do in this book is to work out the particulars and the implications of that powerful notion in greater historical and theoretical detail than anyone has attempted until now, to the best of my knowledge. If, indeed, the Talmud is the/a homeland of the Jews, what does that say about the historical and theoretical description of the Jews as a diaspora? First, the book explores some of the actual textual practices within and around the Talmud that make the topos more than a pretty metaphor; second, it queries (or rather, I query through its agency) what difference that makes for thinking diaspora as a theoretical/historical category for understanding the history of the Jews, as well as contexts broader than that of the Jewish people. On the first of these issues, I will try to show how the Talmud constructs through its own textual practice a diaspora according to a precise definition offered in Chapter 1, and I will argue that those very textual practices subtended a further set of practices around the Talmud until nearly the present (or even beyond it), which further maintained a diasporic existence. In other words, I suggest that the Talmud is a diasporist text that engenders diasporic existence and practice. On the second issue, I will suggest how these specifications might add to a robustly reconfigured notion of "diaspora" and ways that it can usefully be distinguished from some other closely related terms of art.</p><p>"Diaspora," in its original sense, while founded on a Greek word meaning "scattering" and thus implying some sort of a point of origin, unlike "exile," frequently focuses more on the creation of new homes and not on not being at home. Indeed, the Septuagint uses a mixture of positive and negative terms, <i>paroikï¿½a</i> (sojourning), <i>metoikesï¿½a</i> (captivity), <i>apoikï¿½a</i> (colony) for the Hebrew <i>gola</i>&#x2014;usually translated "exile"&#x2014;and never "diaspora." As Unnik concludes, the translators of the Septuagint "inscribed their situation not as 'Exile' but as something else." According to Unnik, the "something else" was, nonetheless, generally negatively charged. However, even in Hebrew/Aramaic, this term <i>gola</i> is not always negatively charged. Thus the Rabbis can say: "Be a <i>goleh</i> to a place of Torah!" As we will see Chapter 1, that is how they frequently understood the move to Babylonia: as a move to a better place, where the Torah could be studied more easily. We cannot think of the Jewish diaspora, therefore, as always and everywhere being understood as a forced and oppressive exile. Of Philo, historian Steve Mason has remarked: "Putting Judaeans on the same level as Romans or early Greek monarchies, he speaks of what we nowadays call 'the Jewish diaspora'&#x2014;a term signifying dislocation and possibly distress&#x2014;as rather a positive <i>colonization</i>: the colonies abroad [<i>apoikï¿½ai</i>] in other prosperous lands preserve the customs of the mother-city."</p><p>It is time, once and for all, to dispose of the false etymology that interprets diaspora as the "scattering of male seed," and thus, eo ipso, masculinist. The Greek verb <i>speirein</i>, from which it is derived, means "to scatter," and it does frequently carry the senses of "to scatter seed" and "to procreate" (for males) (incidentally giving the lie to Stefan Helmreich's claim, repeated by Robin Cohen, that this "scattering of seed" is somehow a uniquely Judaeo-Christian and Islamic metaphor), but this has no bearing on the meaning of <i>diaspeirein</i> in the Greek of the Septuagint, which has nary a hint of such interpretations. Helmreich's conclusion from his false etymologizing that "[d]iaspora, in its traditional sense, thus refers us to a system of kinship reckoned through men and suggests the questions of legitimacy in paternity that patriarchy generates" is beyond science fiction and into the realm of fantasy. As Johannes Tromp makes clear, the meaning of the verb is originally simply "to spread," without any further connotations. Nothing in the formation or use of the verb <i>diaspeirein</i> (apparently a Septuagintal neologism) implies planting, seeding, sowing, or male ejaculation. Jewish diaspora certainly was masculinist, as we shall see, but there is nothing in the etymology of the term that makes it semantically necessary that it be so.</p><p>Initially, it would seem, the verb simply referred to the spread-out nature of the people. However, as Tromp makes clear, it carries as well a further and much more sinister connotation: the scattering of the defeated enemy. The god, as defender of his people, causes their enemies to scatter before him and them. When the god is angered, he causes his people to scatter before the enemies. Given this fraught set of meanings <i>ab origine</i>, it is no wonder that later, the term "diaspora," derived from this verb, would carry a variety of affective connotations as well.</p><p>In the chapters that follow, I will explore one particular Jewish diaspora (for, as we can divine, a diaspora is not one): the one produced by the Babylonian Talmud. The Talmud produces diaspora in three ways, corresponding to my three chapters below. In Chapter 2, "At Home in Babylonia: The Talmud as Diasporist Manifesto," I will show how the Talmud imagines its own community, how it projects its being in Babylonia, its raison d'ï¿½tre, the status of Palestine, and its own status vis-ï¿½-vis Palestine as well. I will argue that multiple passages in the Talmud add up to a virtual diasporist manifesto, acknowledging that there are other much less sanguine voices to be found also. This controversy is thematized in the Talmud in the practice and discourse of different Rabbis.</p><p>In Chapter 3, "In the Land of Talmud: The Textual Making of a Diasporic Folk," several examples of analysis of talmudic texts are undertaken to show how the talmudic sugya (sustained dialectical engagement with a particular issue) is constructed seamlessly but highly significantly out of Palestinian and Babylonian materials constructing the two geographically dispersed collectives as dwellers in one place, the Land of Talmud. It is in this chapter, the longest, that the main argument for diaspora as doubled cultural location is pursued.</p><p>In Chapter 4, "Looking for Our Routes; or, the Talmud and the Making of Diasporas: Sefarad and Ashkenaz," the argument shifts gears, demonstrating the ongoing productivity of the doubled (bifocal) cultural production produced by the Talmud as it traverses different times and climes, the methods of its study ever developing via contact with circumambient culture and moving on to other Jewish collectives in other places where other cultural discourses become incorporated into and affected by talmudic learning.</p><p>Following my revered teacher to whose memory this volume is dedicated, Prof. Hayyim Zalman Dimitrovsky, I argue that it is the talmudic study itself that has constituted the Jewish people as a diaspora.</p></p><h2>Saint Augustine (Penguin Lives)</h2><p>The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Lincoln at Gettysburg furnishes an incisive portrait of one of the founding fathers of Western religious philosophy, challenging misconceptions concerning his early hedonistic life and his influential interpretations of Christian doctrine. 15,000 first printing. BOMC Alt &amp; QPB.</p><p><i>Saint Augustine</i>, by Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and cultural critic Garry Wills, is a 145-page biography of a saint whose collected works total 13 volumes. Despite its brevity, the book offers a complex and compelling interpretation of Augustine's life and work. Much of Wills's task is demythologizing: Augustine was not a central figure in 4th-century Christianity but was "peripheral in his day, a provincial on the margins of classical culture," who did not know Greek, the intellectual lingua franca of his time. Although Augustine has been portrayed by artists as a bishop "wearing all the episcopal finery of the late Middle Ages," he actually "dressed in the gray clothes of a monk." And far from being a self-righteous pontificator, Augustine was "impatient with all preceding formulations, even his own." He wrote, "Since it is God we are speaking of, you do not understand it. If you could understand it, it would not be God." Wills also argues that Augustine's <i>Confessions</i> (which, Wills persuades the reader, is an anachronistic, egoistic translation of the original Latin title, a word Wills more accurately renders as "Testimony") has been misread in a way that suggests Augustine led a debauched sexual life before his conversion. In the Shocking Revelation department, Wills does, however, find more detailed (if elaborately coded) information about Augustine's mistress and about the son they raised together than other biographers have found. Like Wills's masterful <i>Lincoln at Gettysburg</i>, <i>Saint Augustine</i> accomplishes its revisionist aims completely and yet lightly. Wills makes his arguments without ever forgetting his first job: telling the story of a life. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>4 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Comic Wars: How Two Tycoons Battled Over the Marvel Comics Empire--And Both Lost</h2><p><b>Embarrassed billionaires tried to keep a lid on this story, but it cried out to be told: how America's greatest comic-book company was driven to the brink of insolvency by warring tycoons and rescued from the abyss by two obscure but wily entrepreneurs. <br><br></b>In the late 1980s, financier Ronald Perelman, worth billions and riding high after his hostile takeover of the cosmetics firm Revlon, bought Marvel Entertainment&#x2013;legendary creator of Captain America, the Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man, the X-Men, and other superheroes&#x2013;and he had big plans.

Why should we preserve it, and how? In this book renowned philosopher Roger Scruton defends Western culture against its internal critics and external enemies, and argues that rumours of its death are seriously exaggerated. He shows our culture to be a continuing source of moral knowledge, and rebuts the fashionable sarcasm which sees it as nothing more than the useless legacy of &#39;dead white European males&#39;. He is robust in defence of traditional architecture and figurative painting, critical of the fashionable relativists and urgent in his plea for our civilization, which more than ever stands in need of the self-knowledge and self-confidence that are the gift of serious culture.</p><p>Roger Scruton has written an aggressive, provocative, and persuasive counterattack against the nihilism of modern intellectuals who would repudiate the high culture of America and the West. <p>- Robert H.

Twerski calls it &#34;addictologia&#34;--the inability to reason with oneself. He demonstrates how such thinking is a &#34; disease of the will&#34; that makes the addict unable to make wise, constructive choices in life.</p><p>Dr. Abraham J. Twerski is founder and medical director emeritus of the Gateway Rehabilitation Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A rabbi, psychiatrist, and chemical dependency counselor, he is the author of numerous journal articles and books, including Self-Discovery in Recovery, I Didn&#39;t Ask to Be in This Family: Sibling Relationships and How They Shape Adult Behavior and Dependencies, and, with &#34;Peanuts&#34; cartoonist Charles Schulz, When Do the Good Things Start?<p><strong>Chapter 1<br>What Is Addictive Thinking?</strong></p> <p><br>Interviewing Ray, a young man who had been admitted to a rehabilitation unit for drug addiction, I asked, "What made you decide it was time to do something about the problem?"<br><br>"I've been on cocaine for a few years," Ray replied, "and occasionally I'd quit using for a few weeks at a time, but I'd never decided to stop for good before."<br><br>"For the past year my wife has been pressuring me to stop completely. She used to do cocaine too, but she's been off for several years now. I finally got to the point where doing coke wasn't worth the hassle, so I decided to give it up completely."<br><br>"I sincerely wanted to stop for good, but after two weeks I started up again, and that proved something to me. I'm not stupid. I now know that it is absolutely impossible for me to stop on my own, maybe."<br><br>I repeated Ray's last sentence several times because I wanted him to hear what he had just said. But he could not see what I was trying to point out.<br><br>I said, "It is perfectly logical to say, 'Maybe I can stop by myself.<em>'</em> It is also perfectly logical to say, 'It is absolutely impossible for me to stop by myself.<em>'</em> But to say, 'I now know that it is <em>absolutely impossible</em> for me to stop on my own, <em>maybe,'</em> is absurd because it is self-contradictory. It is either 'absolutely impossible<em>'</em> or 'maybe,<em>'</em> but it cannot be both." Ray, however, was unable to see my point.<br><br>I have repeated this conversation to a number of people, and even seasoned therapists initially show no reaction, waiting for the punch line. Only after I point out the contradiction between "absolutely impossible" and "maybe" do they see the absurdity of the statement and the distortion of thought taking place in this man's mind.</p> <p><strong><br>Distortion of Thought</strong></p> <p><br>The phenomenon of abnormal thinking in addiction was first recognized in Alcoholics Anonymous, where the highly descriptive term <em>stinkin' thinkin'</em> was coined. Old-timers in AA use this term to describe the "dry drunk," or the alcoholic who abstains from drinking but behaves in many other ways much like an active drinker.<br><br>Distortions of thinking are not unique to addictive disorders, however; nor are they necessarily related to chemical use at all. Thought distortions can be found in people who may have other adjustment problems. For example, one young woman was procrastinating turning in her term paper for a class. <br><br>"Why don't you finish it?" I asked. <br><br>"It's finished already," she said. <br><br>"Then why haven't you submitted it?" I asked. <br><br>"Because I need to do some more work on it," she said. <br><br>"But I thought you said it's finished," I remarked. <br><br>"It is," she said. <br><br>While her assertion appears illogical to most people, it can make perfect sense to someone who thinks addictively. Furthermore, although distorted thinking does not necessarily indicate addiction, the intensity and regularity of this type of thinking are most common among addicts.<br><br>We all recognize that the statements "The term paper is all finished" and "I have to do more work on it" are contradictory. But Ray's statement, "I now know that it is absolutely impossible for me to stop on my own, maybe," may not appear absurd until we stop to analyze it. In normal conversation, we generally do not have time to pause and analyze what we hear. Hence, we may be deceived by, and accept as reasonable, statements that are meaningless.<br><br>Sometimes these contradictions can be even more subtle. For example, a woman, asked whether she had resolved all the conflicts connected with her divorce, answered, "I think so." There is nothing patently absurd about this woman's answer, until we pause to analyze it. The question "Have you resolved the conflicts?" means "Have you done away with the various uncertainties and eliminated the emotional problems incidental to your divorce?" That is what the word resolved means. The answer "I think so" is thus an assertion "I am still uncertain that I am certain" and is really meaningless.</p> <p><strong><br>Thinking Processes in Schizophrenia</strong></p> <p><br>To understand more fully what we are talking about when we use the term<em> distortion of thought, </em>let's look at an extreme example of it, the system of thinking used by a schizophrenic person. As absurd as a particular distorted thought may be to a healthy person, it may make perfect sense to a schizophrenic.<br><br>Therapists familiar with paranoid schizophrenic patients who have delusions of grandeur know how futile it is trying to convince a patient that he or she is not the Messiah or the victim of worldwide conspiracy. The therapist and the patient are operating on two totally different wavelengths, with two completely different rules of thought. Normal thinking is as absurd to a schizophrenic as schizophrenic thinking is to a healthy person. A typical schizophrenic's adjustment to life in a normal society can be described in terms of a baseball manager who orders the team to punt or a football coach who calls for stealing a base.<br><br>Schizophrenic people do not realize that their thinking processes are different from the thinking processes of most other people. They can't see why others refuse to recognize them as the Messiah or the victim of a worldwide conspiracy. Still, many people, some therapists included, may argue with a schizophrenic person and then become frustrated when the person fails to see the validity of their arguments. But this is like asking a color-blind person to distinguish colors.<br><br>Yet the thinking of the schizophrenic is so obviously irrational that most of us clearly recognize it as such. We may not be able to communicate effectively with a schizophrenic person, but at least we are not fooled by the delusions created in the schizophrenic's mind. We are more frequently taken in by the relative subtlety of distortions caused by addictive thinking.<br></p> <p><strong><br>How Addictive Diseases Resemble Schizophrenia</strong></p> <p><br>Sometimes people with addictive diseases are misdiagnosed as schizophrenic. They may have some of the same symptoms, including<br><br>ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delusions<br>ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hallucinations<br>ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inappropriate moods<br>ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very abnormal behavior<br></p> <p><br>All of these symptoms, however, may be manifestations of the toxic effects of chemicals on the brain. These people have what is called a chemically induced psychosis, which may resemble but is not schizophrenia. These symptoms usually disappear after the chemical toxicity is alleviated and the brain chemistry returns to normal.<br><br>A person with schizophrenia, however, may also use alcohol or other drugs addictively. This presents a very difficult treatment problem. A schizophrenic is likely to require long-term maintenance on potent antipsychotic medications. Furthermore, a person with schizophrenia may not be able to tolerate the confrontational techniques commonly effective with addicts in treatment. Therapists teach addicts to desist from escapism and to use their skills to cope effectively with reality. No such demands can be made on a schizophrenic, who may actually lack the ability to cope with reality.<br><br>In a sense, both the addict and the schizophrenic are like derailed trains. With some effort, an addict can be put back onto the track. The schizophrenic, however, can't be put back on the same track. The best that may be accomplished is getting this person on another track that leads to the destination. This other track is not a 'through' track. It has countless junctions and turnoffs, and at any point the schizophrenic may go off in a direction other than the desired one. Constant vigilance and guidance are necessary to avoid such turnoffs, and it may be necessary to use medications to slow the traveling speed and stay on track. <br><br>Being confronted with the thinking of an alcoholic, or someone with another addiction, can be as frustrating as dealing with the schizophrenic. Just as we are unable to budge the schizophrenic from the conviction of being the Messiah, so we are unable to budge an alcoholic from the belief that he or she is a safe, social drinker, or a safe user of tranquilizers, or a "recreational" user of marijuana and cocaine.<br><br>For instance, someone close enough to observe a late-stage alcoholic (or other drug addict) sees a person whose life is steadily falling apart; perhaps the addict's physical health is deteriorating, family life is in ruins, and job is in jeopardy. All of these problems are obviously due to the effects of alcohol or other drugs, yet the addict appears unable to recognize this. He or she may firmly believe that using chemicals has nothing to do with any of these problems and seems blind to logical arguments to the contrary. <br><br>A defining difference between addictive thinking and schizophrenic thinking is this:<br><br>ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; schizophrenic thinking is blatantly absurd<br>ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; addictive thinking has a superficial logic that can be very seductive and misleading<br></p> <p>The addict may not always be as willfully conniving as others think. This person is not necessarily consciously and purposely misleading others, though this does occur sometimes. Often addicts are taken in by their own thinking, actually deceiving themselves.<br><br>Especially in the early stages of addiction, an addict's perspective and account of what is happening may look reasonable on the surface. As discussed, many people are naturally taken in by addictive reasoning. Thus, an addict's family may see things the "addictive thinking way" for a long time. The addict may sound convincing to friends, pastor, employer, doctor, or even to a psychotherapist. Each statement the addict makes appears to hold up; long accounts of events may even appear valid.</p> <p><strong><br>Obsessions and Compu...</strong></p></p><h2>World Without End (Kingsbridge)</h2><p><p><b>#1<i> New York Times</i> Bestseller</b><br><br><b>In 1989, Ken Follett astonished the literary world with&nbsp;<i>The Pillars of the Earth</i>, a sweeping epic novel set in twelfth-century England centered on the building of a cathedral and many of the hundreds of lives it affected.

It was a bestseller when it was published in 1989, but it's only gained in popularity since then--it's the kind of book that people are incredibly passionate about. What has it been like to see it grow an audience like that? </p><p> <strong>Follett:</strong> At first I was a little disappointed that <i>Pillars</i> sold not much better than my previous book. Now I think that was because it was a little different and people were not sure how to take it. As the years went by and it became more and more popular, I felt kind of vindicated. And I was very grateful to readers who spread the news by word of mouth. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> <i>Pillars</i> was a departure for you from your very successful modern thrillers, and after writing it you returned to thrillers. Did you think you'd ever come back to the medieval period? What brought you to do so after 18 years? </p><p> <strong>Follett:</strong> The main reason was the way people talk to me about <i>Pillars</i>. Some readers say, "It&#x2019;s the best book I&#x2019;ve ever read." Others tell me they have read it two or three times. I got to the point where I really had to find out whether I could do that again. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> In <i>World Without End</i> you return to Kingsbridge, the same town as the previous book, but two centuries later. What has changed in two hundred years? </p><p><strong>Follett:</strong> In the time of Prior Philip, the monastery was a powerful force for good in medieval society, fostering education and technological advance. Two hundred years later it has become a wealthy and conservative institution that tries to hold back change. This leads to some of the major conflicts in the story. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> <i>World Without End</i> features two strong-willed female characters, Caris and Gwenda. What room to maneuver did a medieval English town provide for a woman of ambition? </p><p> <strong>Follett:</strong> Medieval people paid lip-service to the idea that women were inferior, but in practice women could be merchants, craftspeople, abbesses, and queens. There were restrictions, but strong women often found ways around them. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> When you sit down to imagine yourself into the 14th century, what is the greatest leap of imagination you have to make from our time to theirs? Is there something we can learn from that age that has been lost in our own time? </p><p> <strong>Follett:</strong> It&#x2019;s hard to imagine being so dirty. People bathed very rarely, and they must have smelled pretty bad. And what was kissing like in the time before toothpaste was invented? </p><p><b>Ken Follett</b>&nbsp;is one of the world&#x2019;s best-loved authors, selling more than 160 million copies of his thirty books.

But her toddler son Ralph, her Midwestern sense of getting on with it, her oddball sense of humor, and her writing kept her putting one foot in front of the other. Being in absolute and utter shock didn&#x2019;t hurt, either. One result was <em>It&#x2019;s Okay to Laugh</em>, her memoir written at a fever pitch in the six months after Aaron&#x2019;s death, a national bestseller that earned Nora the mantle &#x201c;Anne Lamott for the emoji generation.&#x201d; On the heels of the book came her award-winning podcast, <em>Terrible, Thanks for Asking</em>, called &#x201c;a gift to be able to listen to&#x201d; by the <em>New York Times</em>; a TED Talk; and writing gigs for <em>Elle</em>, <em>Time</em>, <em>Slate</em>, <em>Vox</em>, <em>BuzzFeed</em>, and lots of other cool places. </p><p>In under a year, Nora had become one of the biggest (and youngest) voices on living honestly and messily through grief.</p><p>And then something really crazy happened. One night while sitting around a backyard bonfire at a friend&#x2019;s house, she met a guy who literally fell out of his chair introducing himself. And against all notions of what would be considered kosher or cautious or wise, in a few months she was pregnant, and she and Matthew were figuring out how to blend their families and just how new love and new grief feel when they&#x2019;re braided together in a new relationship.</p><p>&nbsp;You see, life has a million different ways to kick you right in the chops.

Presented in full color, the 250 posters gathered here range in themes from warnings about the dangers of alcohol abuse and the creeping Nazi menace to illustrations of utopian harmony and the Soviet industrial machine.

In fact, one might say that the natural state of Nietzsche&#x2019;s reader is one of perplexity. Yet it is in the process of overcoming the perplexity that one realizes how rewarding to have one&#x2019;s ideas challenged. In <i>Beyond Good and Evil,</i> Nietzsche critiques the mediocre in modernity and challenges the reader to accept their state of becoming and accept improvisation and creativity of the process. Nietzsche&#x2019;s book is carefully designed to disorient the reader, to systematically provoke and tease her to the point of stealing away her certainties. It is challenging yet rewarding to overcome the perplexities of Nietzsche&#x2019;s teachings.</p></p><p>After kicking open the doors to twentieth-century philosophy in <i>Thus Spake Zarathustra,</i> Friedrich Nietzsche refined his ideal of the superman with the 1886 publication of <i>Beyond Good and Evil.</i> Conventional morality is a sign of slavery, Nietzsche maintains, and the superman goes beyond good and evil in action, thought, and creation. Nietzsche especially targets what he calls a "slave morality" that fosters herdlike quiescence and stigmatizes the "highest human types." In this pathbreaking work, Nietzsche's philosophical and literary powers are at their height: with devastating irony and flashing wit he gleefully dynamites centuries of accumulated conventional wisdom in metaphysics, morals, and psychology, clearing a path for such twentieth-century innovators as Thomas Mann, Andrï¿½ Gide, Sigmund Freud, George Bernard Shaw, Andrï¿½ Malraux, and Jean-Paul Sartre, all of whom openly acknowledged their debt to him. Students of philosophy and literature as well as general readers will prize this rich sampling of Nietzsche's thought in an unabridged and inexpensive edition of one of the philosopher's most important works. Dover (1997) unabridged republication of the Helen Zimmern translation. Publisher's Introduction.<p><strong>Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche was born in the village of Rï¿½cken in Saxony on October 15, 1844. Nietzsche, whose father was a Lutheran pastor, spent a year as a theology student at the University of Bonn, before studying classical philology at the University of Leipzig. Despite poor health and desperate loneliness, Nietzsche managed to produce a book (or a book-length supplement to an earlier publication) every year from 1878 to 1887. In early January 1889, he collapsed in the street in Turin, Italy, confused and incoherent. He spent the last eleven years of his life institutionalized or under the care of his family.</strong></p></p><h2>Good Boats</h2><p>In GOOD BOATS Taylor shares his favorite designs with fellow boat lovers.

Now that we're used to reading about sex, and seeing it in the movies, it's apparent that the novel is memorable for better reasons: namely, that Lawrence was a masterful and lyrical writer, whose story takes us bodily into the world of its characters.The Cambridge edition of Lady Chatterley&#39;s Lover is the first ever to restore to Lawrence&#39;s most famous novel the words that he wrote.

These are the Nac Mac Feegles, the pictsies, who like nothing better than thievin&#39;, fightin&#39; and drinkin&#39;. Then Tiffany&#39;s young brother goes missing and Tiffany and the Wee Free Men must join forces to save him from the Queen of the Fairies...</p><p>Nine-year-old Tiffany Aching needs magic--fast! Her sticky little brother Wentworth has been spirited away by the evil Queen of faerie, and it&#x2019;s up to her to get him back safely. Having already decided to grow up to be a witch, now all Tiffany has to do is find her power. But she quickly learns that it&#x2019;s not all black cats and broomsticks. According to her witchy mentor Miss Tick, "Witches don&#x2019;t use magic unless they really have to...We do other things. A witch pays attention to everything that&#x2019;s going on...A witch uses her head...A witch always has a piece of string!" Luckily, besides her trusty string, Tiffany&#x2019;s also got the Nac Mac Feegles, or the Wee Free Men on her side. Small, blue, and heavily tattooed, the Feegles love nothing more than a good fight except maybe a drop of strong drink! Tiffany, heavily armed with an iron skillet, the feisty Feegles, and a talking toad on loan from Miss Tick, is a formidable adversary. But the Queen has a few tricks of her own, most of them deadly. Tiffany and the Feegles might get more than they bargained for on the flip side of Faerie! Prolific fantasy author Terry Pratchett has served up another delicious helping of his famed Discworld fare. The not-quite-teen set will delight in the Feegles&#x2019; spicy, irreverent dialogue and Tiffany&#x2019;s salty determination. Novices to Pratchett&#x2019;s prose will find much to like here, and quickly go back to devour the rest of his Discworld offerings. Scrumptiously recommended.

Forced into Fairyland to seek her kidnaped brother, Tiffany allies herself with the Chalk's local Nac Mac Feegle -- aka the Wee Free Men -- a clan of sheep-stealing, sword-wielding, six-inch-high blue men who are as fierce as they are funny. Together they battle through an eerie and ever-shifting landscape, fighting brutal flying fairies, dream-spinning dromes, and grimhounds -- black dogs with eyes of fire and teeth of razors -- before ultimately confronting the Queen of the Elves, absolute ruler of a world in which reality intertwines with nightmare.

Darrell Bock&#39;s IVP New Testament Commentary shows why Luke&#39;s Gospel is &#34;tailor-made&#34; for the world we live in--a world often divided along ethnic, religious, economic and political lines. After all, the Jesus portrayed by Luke is a source of unity for his disciples and for believers from every walk of life. Tax collectors, Roman soldiers, prostitutes, city officials, religious leaders, widows and fishermen were among the diverse group brought together in the early Christian church. &#34;The Gospel is universal in its perspective and cosmic in its scope,&#34; Bock writes. &#34;As we look at our modern multicultural world, . . . certainly there is relevance in a Gospel that highlights how men and women of different ethnic origins can be transformed into a unified community.&#34; Along with a passage-by-passage exposition of Luke, Bock offers background information on date, destination, purpose, form and theological themes in the text. His dual focus on understanding what Luke wanted to communicate to his original readers and on discovering how that message is relevant for today&#39;s readers will make this commentary an excellent resource for all who study, preach or teach the Scriptures.</p><p>Darrell L.

The next day, Parkersburg&#x2019;s beloved football coach, Ed Thomas, made a stunning prediction: &#x201c;God willing, we will play our first home game here on this field this season.&#x201d; One hundred days later, the home team scored a victory on the field they dubbed &#x201c;The Sacred Acre,&#x201d; serving as a galvanizing point for the town to band together and rebuild. But just as Parkersburg was recovering, another devastating tragedy struck. While working with a group of football and volleyball players early one morning, one of Ed&#x2019;s former students walked in and gunned him down point blank. Ed Thomas was 58. The murder of this hometown hero spread across national news headlines. Ed&#x2019;s community and family reeled from shock. Yet the story doesn&#x2019;t end here.

He wins over the stunning Lucinda Mandelbaum, &#x201c;the goddess of game theory,&#x201d; and loses himself in a spiritually expansive infatuation. A former girlfriend appears: an anthropologist who invites him to join in her quest for immortality through biochemistry. And he is haunted by reminders of the two people who ignited his passion to understand religion: his mentor and professor&#x2014;a renowned literary scholar with a suspicious obsession with messianism&#x2014;and an angelic six-year-old mathematical genius who is heir to the leadership of a Hasidic sect. Each encounter reinforces Cass&#x2019;s theory that the religious impulse spills over into life at large.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>36 Arguments for the Existence of God</i> plunges into the great debate of our day: the clash between faith and reason. World events are being shaped by fervent believers at home and abroad, while a new atheism is asserting itself in the public sphere. On purely intellectual grounds the skeptics would seem to have everything on their side. Yet people refuse to accept their seemingly irrefutable arguments and continue to embrace faith in God as their source of meaning, purpose, and comfort. <br>&nbsp;<br>Through the enchantment of fiction, award-winning novelist and MacArthur Fellow Rebecca Newberger Goldstein shows that the tension between religion and doubt cannot be understood through rational argument alone. It also must be explored from the point of view of individual people caught in the raptures and torments of religious experience in all their variety.<br>&nbsp;<br>Using her gifts in fiction and philosophy, Goldstein has produced a true crossover novel, complete with a nail-biting debate (&#x201c;Resolved: God Exists&#x201d;) and a stand-alone appendix with the thirty-six arguments (and responses) that propelled Seltzer to stardom.</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Rebecca Goldstein on <em> 36 Arguments for the Existence of God</em></strong><br> <p> </p> <p>Dinner party hostesses used to be warned to steer the conversation away from politics and religion. I used to wonder why, but I don&#x2019;t anymore. There are some differences that reveal rifts so deep that dialogue breaks down. Among these are the current debates that have been raging between God-believers and the so-called new atheists. It often seems that people on one side can&#x2019;t begin to grasp what the world is like, what it feels like, for those on the other side. When the person with whom one is conversing appears utterly opaque, then mistrust and contempt are easily aroused: How can he be saying that when the opposite seems so obvious to me? Is he stupid, dishonest, maybe just a touch evil? These are not the sort of suspicions that the gracious hostess wants intruding at her candle-lit dinner table.</p> <p>But for me, as a novelist, it&#x2019;s differences like these, indicating entirely different orientations toward the world, which are the most tantalizing to explore. Arguments alone can&#x2019;t capture all that is at stake for people when they argue about issues of reason and faith. In the end, I place my faith in fiction, in its power to make vividly present how different the world feels to each of us and how these differences are sometimes what is really being expressed in the great debates of our day on the existence of God.</p> <p>The title of the book is <em>36 Arguments for the Existence of God: A Work of Fiction</em>.

I knew my mother only from the stories Grandmere Catherine and Grandpere Jack told me and from the few faded sepia photographs of her that we had in pewter frames. It seemed that for as long as I could remember, I always felt remorseful when I stood at her grave and gazed at the simple tombstone that read:<br><br>Gabrielle Landry<br><br>Born May 1, 1927<br><br>Died October 27, 1947<br><br>for my birth date and the date of her death were one and the same. Everyday and every night, I carried in my secret heart the ache of guilt when my birthday came around, despite the great effort Grandmere went through to make it a happy day. I knew it was as hard for her to be joyful as it was for me.<br><br>But over and above my mother's sad, sad death when I was born, there were dark questions I could never ask, even if I knew how, because I'd be much too scared it would make my grandmother's face, usually so loving, take on that closed, hooded look I dreaded. Some days she sat silently in her rocker and stared at me for what seemed like hours. Whatever the answers were, the truth had torn my grandparents to pieces; it had sent Grandpere Jack into the swamp to live alone in his shack. And from that day forward, Grandmere Catherine could not think of him without great anger flashing from her eyes and sorrow burning in her heart.<br><br>The unknown lingered over our house in the bayou; it hung in the spiderwebs that turned the swamps into a jeweled world on moonlit nights; it was draped over the cypress trees like the Spanish moss that dangled over their branches. I heard it in the whispering warm summer breezes and in the water lapping against the clay. I even felt it in the piercing glance of the marsh hawk, whose yellow-circled eyes followed my every move.<br><br>I hid from the answers just as much as I longed to know them. Words that carried enough weight and power to keep two people apart who should love and cherish each other could only fill me with fear.<br><br>I would sit by my window and stare into the darkness of the swamp on a warm, spring night, letting the breeze that swept in over the swamps from the Gulf of Mexico cool my face; and I would listen to the owl.<br><br>But instead of his unearthly cry of "Who, Who, Who," I would hear him call "Why, Why, Why" and I would embrace myself more tightly to keep the trembling from reaching my pounding heart.<br><br><b>Chapter 1: Grandmere's Powers</b><br><br>A loud and desperate rapping on our screen door echoed through the house and drew both my and Grandmere Catherine's attention from our work. That night we were upstairs in the <i>grenier,</i> the loom room, weaving the cotton jaune into blankets we would sell at the stand in front of our house on weekends when the tourists came to the bayou. I held my breath. The knocking came again, louder and more frantic.<br><br>"Go down and see who's there, Ruby," Grandmere Catherine whispered loudly. "Quickly. And if it's your Grandpere Jack soaked in that swamp whiskey again, shut the door as fast as you can," she added, but something in the way her dark eyes widened said she knew this was someone else and something far more frightening and unpleasant.<br><br>A strong breeze had kicked up behind the thick layers of dark clouds that enclosed us like a shroud, hiding the quarter moon and stars in the April Louisiana sky. This year spring had been more like summer. The days and nights were so hot and humid I found mildew on my shoes in the morning. At noon the sun made the goldenrod glisten and drove the gnats and flies into a frenzy to find cool shade. On clear nights I could see where the swamp's Golden Lady spiders had come out to erect their giant nets for their nightly catch of beetles and mosquitos. We had stretched fabric over our windows that kept out the insects but let in whatever cool breeze came up from the Gulf.<br><br>I hurried down the stairs and through the narrow hallway that ran straight from the rear of the house to the front. The sight of Theresa Rodrigues's face with her nose against the screen stopped me in my tracks and turned my feet to lead. She looked as white as a water lily, her coffee black hair wild and her eyes full of terror.<br><br>"Where's your grandmere?" she cried frantically.<br><br>I called out to my grandmother and then stepped up to the door. Theresa was a short, stout girl three years older than I. At eighteen, she was the oldest of five children. I knew her mother was about to have another. "What's wrong, Theresa?" I asked, joining her on the galerie. "Is it your mother?"<br><br>Immediately, she burst into tears, her heavy bosom heaving and falling with the sobs, her face in her hands. I looked back into the house in time to see Grandmere Catherine come down the stairs, take one look at Theresa, and cross herself.<br><br>"Speak quickly, child," Grandmere Catherine demanded, rushing up to the door.<br><br>"My mama...gave birth...to a dead baby," Theresa wailed.<br><br><i>"Mon Dieu,"</i> Grandmere Catherine said, and crossed herself once more. "I felt it," she muttered, her eyes turned to me. I recalled the moments during our weaving when she had raised her gaze and had seemed to listen to the sounds of the night. The cry of a raccoon had sounded like the cry of a baby.<br><br>"My father sent me to fetch you," Theresa moaned through her tears. Grandmere Catherine nodded and squeezed Theresa's hand reassuringly.<br><br>"I'm coming right away."<br><br>"Thank you, Mrs. Landry. Thank you," Theresa said, and shot off the porch and into the night, leaving me confused and frightened. Grandmere Catherine was already gathering her things and filling a split-oak basket. Quickly, I went back inside.<br><br>"What does Mr. Rodrigues want, Grandmere? What can you do for them now?"<br><br>When Grandmere was summoned at night, it usually meant someone was very sick or in pain. No matter what it was, my stomach would tingle as if I had swallowed a dozen flies that buzzed around and around inside.<br><br>"Get the butane lantern," she ordered instead of answering. I hurried to do so. Unlike the frantic Theresa Rodrigues whose terror had lit her way through the darkness, we would need the lantern to go from the front porch and over the marsh grass to the inky black gravel highway. To Grandmere the overcast night sky carried an ominous meaning, especially tonight. As soon as we stepped out and she looked up, she shook her head and muttered, "Not a good sign."<br><br>Behind us and beside us, the swamp seemed to come alive with her dark words. Frogs croaked, night birds cawed, and gators slithered over the cool mud.<br><br>At fifteen I was already two inches taller than Grandmere Catherine who was barely five-feet-four in her moccasins. Diminutive in size, she was still the strongest woman I knew, for besides her wisdom and her grit, she carried the powers of a <i>Traiteur,</i> a treater; she was a spiritual healer, someone unafraid to do battle with evil, no matter how dark or insidious that evil was. Grandmere always seemed to have a solution, always seemed to reach back in her bag of cure-alls and rituals and manage to find the proper course of action. It was something unwritten, something handed down to her, and whatever was not handed down, she magically knew herself.<br><br>Grandmere was left-handed, which to all of us Cajuns meant she could have spiritual powers. But I thought her power came from her dark onyx eyes. She was never afraid of anything. Legend had it that one night in the swamp she had come face-to-face with the Grim Reaper himself and she'd stared down Death's gaze until he realized she was no one to tangle with just yet.<br><br>People in the bayou came to her to cure their warts and their rheumatism. She had her secret medicines for colds and coughs and was said even to know a way to prevent aging, although she never used it because it would be against the natural order of things. Nature was sacred to Grandmere Catherine. She extracted all of her remedies from the plants and herbs, the trees and animals that lived near or in the swamps.<br><br>"Why are we going to the Rodrigues house, Grandmere? Isn't it too late?"<br><br><i>"Couchernal,"</i> she muttered, and mumbled a prayer under her breath. The way she prayed made my spine tingle and, despite the humidity, gave me a chill. I clenched my teeth together as hard as I could, hoping they wouldn't chatter. I was determined to be as fearless as Grandmere, and most of the time I succeeded.<br><br>"I guess that you are old enough for me to tell you," she said so quietly I had to strain to hear. "A couchernal is an evil spirit that lurks about when an unbaptized baby dies. If we don't drive it away, it will haunt the family and bring them bad luck," she said. "They should have called me as soon as Mrs. Rodrigues started her birthing. Especially on a night like this," she added darkly.<br><br>In front of us, the glow of the butane lantern made the shadows dance and wiggle to what Grandpere Jack called "The Song of the Swamp," a song not only made up of animal sounds, but also the peculiar low whistle that sometimes emerged from the twisted limbs and dangling Spanish moss we Cajuns called Spanish Beard when a breeze traveled through. I tried to stay as close to Grandmere as I could without knocking into her and my feet were moving as quickly as they could to keep up. Grandmere was so ftxed on our destination, and on the astonishing task before us that she looked like she could walk through the pitch darkness.<br><br>In her split-oak basket, Grandmere carried a half-dozen small totems of the Virgin Mary, as well as a bottle of holy water and some assorted herbs and plants. The prayers and incantations she carried in her head.<br><br>"Grandmere," I began. I needed to hear the sound of my own voice. <i>"Qu'est-ce -- "</i><br><br>"English," she corrected quickly. "Speak only in English." Grandmere always insisted we speak English, especially when we left the house, even though our Cajun language was French. "Someday you will leave this bayou," she predicted, "and you will live in a world that maybe looks down on our Cajun language and ways."<br><br>"Why would I leave the bayou, Grandmere?" I asked her. "And why would I stay with people who looked down on us?"<br><br>"You just will," she replied in her usual cryptic manner. "You just will."<br><br>"Grandmere," I began again, "why would a spirit haunt the Rodrigueses anyway? What have they done?"<br><br>"They've done nothing. The baby was born dead. It came in the body of the infant, but the spirit was unbaptized and has no place to go, so it will haunt them and bring them bad luck."<br><br>I looked back. Night fell like a leaden curtain behind us, pushing us forward. When we made the turn, I was happy to see the lighted windows of the Butes, our closest neighbor. The sight of it allowed me to pretend that everything was normal.<br><br>"Have you done this many times before, Grandmere?" I knew my grandmother was called to perform many rituals, from blessing a new house to bringing luck to a shrimp or oyster fisherman. Mothers of young brides unable to bear children called her to do whatever she could to make them fertile. More often than not, they became pregnant. I knew of all these things, but until tonight I had never heard of a couchernal.<br><br>"Unfortunately, many times," she replied. "As did Traiteurs before me as far back as our days in the old country."<br><br>"And did you always succeed in chasing away the evil spirit?"<br><br>"Always," she replied with a tone of such confidence that I suddenly felt safe.<br><br>Grandmere Catherine and I lived alone in out toothpicklegged house with its tin roof and recessed galerie. We lived in Houma, Louisiana, which was in Terrebonne Parish. Folks said the parish was only two hours away from New Orleans by car, but I didn't know if that was true since I had never been to New Orleans. I had never left the bayou.<br><br>Grandpere Jack had built our house himself more than thirty years ago when he and Grandmere Catherine had first been married. Like most Cajun homes, our house was set on posts to keep us above the crawling animals and give us some protection from the floods and dampness. Its walls were built out of cypress wood and its roof out of corrugated metal. Whenever it rained, the drops would tap our house like a drum. The rare stranger to come to our house was sometimes bothered by it, but we were as accustomed to the drumming as we were to the shrieks of the marsh hawks.<br><br>"Where does the spirit go when we drive it away?" I asked.<br><br>"Back to limbo where it can do good God-fearing folks no harm," she replied.<br><br>We Cajuns, who were descendants of the Arcadians driven from Canada in the mid-1700s, believed in a spirituality that commingled Catholicism with pre-Christian folklore. We went to church and prayed to saints like Saint Medad, but we clung to our superstitions and age-old beliefs as firmly. Some, like Grandpere Jack, clung to them more. He was often involved in some activity to ward off bad luck and had an assortment of talismans like alligator teeth and dried deer ears to wear around his neck or carry on his belt at times. Grandmere said no man in the bayou needed them more than he did.<br><br>The gravel road stretched and turned ahead, but at the pace we were keeping, the Rodrigueses' cypress wood house now bleached a gray-white patina, soon loomed before us. We heard the wailing coming from within and saw Mr. Rodrigues on the front galerie holding Theresa's four-year-old brother in his arms. He sat in a split-oak rocking chair and stared into the night as though he had already seen the evil spirit. It chilled me even more, but I moved forward as quickly as Grandmere Catherine did. The moment he set eyes on her, his expression of sorrow and fear turned to one of hope. It felt good to see how much Grandmere was respected.<br><br>"Thanks for comin' so fast, Mrs. Landry. Thanks for comin'," he said, and rose quickly. "Theresa," he cried, and Theresa emerged from the house to take her little brother from him. He opened the door for my grandmother, and after I set the lantern down, I followed her inside.<br><br>Grandmere Catherine had been to the Rodrigueses' house before and went directly to Mrs. Rodrigues's bedroom. She lay there, her eyes closed, her face ashen, her black hair spread out over the pillow. Grandmere took her hand and Mrs. Rodrigues looked up weakly. Grandmere Catherine fixed her gaze on Mrs. Rodrigues and stared hard as though searching for a sign. Mrs. Rodrigues struggled to raise herself.<br><br>"Rest, Delores," Grandmere Catherine said. "I am here to help."<br><br>"Yes," Mrs. Rodrigues said in a loud whisper. She clutched Grandmere's wrist. "I felt it, Catherine. I felt its heartbeat start and stop and then I felt the couchernal slip away. I felt it...."<br><br>"Rest, Delores. I will do what has to be done," Grandmere Catherine promised. She patted her hand and turned to me. She nodded slightly and I followed her out to the galerie, where Theresa and the other Rodrigues children waited wide-eyed.<br><br>Grandmere Catherine reached into her split-oak basket and plucked out one of her bottles of holy water. She opened it carefully and turned to me.<br><br>"Take the lantern and lead me around the house," she said. "Every cistern, every pot with water in it, needs a drop or two of the holy water, Ruby. Make sure we don't miss a one," she warned. I nodded, my legs trembling, and we began our foray.<br><br>In the darkness, an owl hooted, but when we turned the corner of the house, I heard something slither t...</p><h2>Nan Goldin 55 (Phaidon 55s)</h2><p>Nan Goldin (b.1953) is most famous for her long-term photographic record of her immediate circle, The Ballad of Sexual Dependency.

Once aloft, Jack overhears a plot to sabotage the ship. But before he can tell his father, Jack falls, plummeting through the air to be caught in the sails of a pirate ship. Now Jack must try to convince a crew of thieves to rescue his father. . . .<br> <br>In this robust blend of fantasy and whirlwind adventure, Carol Hughes confronts the difficult, real-life issues of trust, loyalty, and deception.</p><p>Pirates! Volcanoes! Hidden islands! Earthquakes! Giant airships! Sea monsters! Jack Black, son of the captain of the <i>Bellerophon</i>, the largest airship in the world, knows he's headed for adventure when he joins his father on an around-the-world trip. But he has no idea of the extent of his upcoming escapades. Starting with a fall from thousands of feet up in the sky, and a miraculous safe landing on a cursed--or blessed, depending on how you look at it--pirate ship, Jack embarks on a wild quest to save his father and the airship, which has been planted with a bomb. Along the way, he helps the buccaneers vanquish an automated war machine, rescue a dashing and beautiful young airplane pilot (who in turn helps save the pirates), and break the curse of the pirate ship. The story includes a cast of unforgettable characters: a lyrical cook drunk on molasses, a pair of gruff twins who have not spoken to each other in 25 years, but who sing in beautiful harmony in their sleep, and an elderly woman who lives quite contentedly on an otherwise uninhabited, virtually unreachable volcanic island. Packed with betrayal, friends from surprising corners, and many lessons in trust and courage, this is a ripsnorting adventure no one will want to put down.

In this first volume of a projected trilogy, she chronicles a passionate (yet decorous) romance, basing her characters on real persons. Anne Couper is celebrating her 18th birthday when the British capture St. Simon's Island, Ga., during the War of 1812. She and a group of her houseguests are held in a far from onerous captivity, and Anne and handsome Lt. John Fraser of the Royal Marines fall in love. Their courtship and marriage create numerous conflicts. Should John accept Anne's father's generous offer of a plantation on St. Simon's Island? Can he, the consummate soldier, regain his commission after the war and rejoin his regiment? The young couple is given counsel and love from a host of agreeable family members and friends, including Anne's distant cousin, a Scottish lord, and his friend author Walter Scott. Anne and John, at times colorless, are far too well bred to display conflict or excitement, yet the book springs to life in its descriptions both of the lush landscape of a Georgia plantation and the wild, primitive highlands of Scotland. 150,000 first printing; Literary Guild and Doubleday Book Club selections. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Natural History Of Dragons</h2><p>Title: A Natural History of Dragons( A Memoir by Lady Trent) &lt;&gt;Binding: Paperback &lt;&gt;Author: MarieBrennan &lt;&gt;Publisher: TorBooks</p><p>Marie Brennan is the author of nine novels, including the Doppelganger and Onyx Court series.

With much excitement, I brought it for my mother to see, but by the time I reached her it had mostly collapsed into ash in my hands. Mama exclaimed in distaste and sent me to wash. <br> <br>Our cook, a tall and gangly woman who nonetheless produced the most amazing soups and soufflï¿½s (thus putting the lie to the notion that one cannot trust a slender cook) was the one who showed me the secret of preserving sparklings after death. She kept one on her dresser top, which she brought out for me to see when I arrived in her kitchen, much cast down from the loss of the sparkling and from my mother&#x2019;s chastisement. &#x201c;However did you keep it?&#x201d; I asked her, wiping away my tears. &#x201c;Mine fell all to pieces.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Vinegar,&#x201d; she said, and that one word set me upon the path that led to where I stand today. <br> <br>If found soon enough after death, a sparkling (as many of the readers of this volume no doubt know) may be preserved by embalming it in vinegar. I sailed forth into our gardens in determined search, a jar of vinegar crammed into one of my dress pockets so the skirt hung all askew. The first one I found lost its right wing in the process of preservation, but before the week was out I had an intact specimen: a sparkling an inch and a half in length, his scales a deep emerald in color. With the boundless ingenuity of a child, I named him Greenie, and he sits on a shelf in my study to this day, tiny wings outspread. <br> <br>Sparklings were not the only things I collected in those days. I&nbsp;was forever bringing home other insects and beetles (for back then we classified sparklings as an insect species that simply resembled dragons, which today we know to be untrue), and many other things besides: interesting rocks, discarded bird feathers, fragments of eggshell, bones of all kinds. Mama threw fits until I formed a pact with my maid, that she would not breathe a word of my treasures, and I would give her an extra hour a week during which she could sit down and rest her feet. Thereafter my collections hid in cigar boxes and the like, tucked safely into my closets where my mother would not go. <br> <br>No doubt some of my inclinations came about because I was the sole daughter in a set of six children. Surrounded as I was by boys, and with our house rather isolated in the countryside of Tamshire, I quite believed that collecting odd things was what children did, regardless of sex. My mother&#x2019;s attempts to educate me otherwise left little mark, I fear. Some of my interest also came from my father, who like any gentleman in those days kept himself moderately informed of developments in all fields: law, theology, economics, natural history, and more. <br> <br>The remainder of it, I fancy, was inborn curiosity. I would sit in the kitchens (where I was permitted to be, if not encouraged, only because it meant I was not outside getting dirty and ruining my dresses), and ask the cook questions as she stripped a chicken carcass for the soup. &#x201c;Why do chickens have wishbones?&#x201d; I asked her one day. <br> <br>One of the kitchen maids answered me in the fatuous tones of an adult addressing a child. &#x201c;To make wishes on!&#x201d; she said brightly, handing me one that had already been dried. &#x201c;You take one side of it&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;I know what we <i>do</i> with them,&#x201d; I said impatiently, cutting her off without much tact. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not what chickens have them for, though, or surely the chicken would have wished not to end up in the pot for our supper.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Heavens, child, I don&#x2019;t know what they grow them for,&#x201d; the cook said. &#x201c;But you find them in all kinds of birds&#x2014;chickens, turkeys, geese, pigeons, and the like.&#x201d; <br> <br>The notion that all birds should share this feature was intriguing, something I had never before considered. My curiosity soon drove me to an act which I blush to think upon today, not for the act itself (as I have done similar things many times since then, if in a more meticulous and scholarly fashion), but for the surreptitious and naive manner in which I carried it out. <br> <br>In my wanderings one day, I found a dove which had fallen dead under a hedgerow. I immediately remembered what the cook had said, that all birds had wishbones. She had not named doves in her list, but doves were birds, were they not? Perhaps I might learn what they were for, as I could not learn when I watched the footman carve up a goose at the dinner table. <br> <br>I took the dove&#x2019;s body and hid it behind the hayrick next to the barn, then stole inside and pinched a penknife from Andrew, the brother immediately senior to me, without him knowing. Once outside again, I settled down to my study of the dove. <br> <br>I was organized, if not perfectly sensible, in my approach to the work. I had seen the maids plucking birds for the cook, so I understood that the first step was to remove the feathers&#x2014;a task which proved harder than I had expected, and appallingly messy. It did afford me a chance, though, to see how the shaft of the feather fitted into its follicle (a word I did not know at the time), and the different kinds of feathers. <br> <br>When the bird was more or less naked, I spent some time moving its wings and feet about, seeing how they operated&#x2014;and, in truth, steeling myself for what I had determined to do next. Eventually curiosity won out over squeamishness, and I took my brother&#x2019;s penknife, set it against the skin of the bird&#x2019;s belly, and cut. <br> <br>The smell was tremendous&#x2014;in retrospect, I&#x2019;m sure I perforated the bowel&#x2014;but my fascination held. I examined the gobbets of flesh that came out, unsure what most of them were, for to me livers and kidneys were things I had only ever seen on a supper plate. I recognized the intestines, however, and made a judicious guess at the lungs and heart. Squeamishness overcome, I continued my work, peeling back the skin, prying away muscles, seeing how it all connected. I uncovered the bones, one by one, marveling at the delicacy of the wings, the wide keel of the sternum. <br> <br>I had just discovered the wishbone when I heard a shout behind me, and turned to see a stableboy staring at me in horror. <br> <br>While he bolted off, I began frantically trying to cover my mess, dragging hay over the dismembered body of the dove, but so distressed was I that the main result was to make myself look even worse than before. By the time Mama arrived on the scene, I was covered in blood and bits of dove-flesh, feathers and hay, and more than a few tears. <br> <br>I will not tax my readers with a detailed description of the treatment I received at that point; the more adventurous among you have no doubt experienced similar chastisement after your own escapades. In the end I found myself in my father&#x2019;s study, standing clean and shamefaced on his Akhian carpet. <br> <br>&#x201c;Isabella,&#x201d; he said, his voice forbidding, &#x201c;what possessed you to do such a thing?&#x201d; <br> <br>Out it all came, in a flood of words, about the dove I had found (I assured him, over and over again, that it had been dead when I came upon it, that I most certainly had not killed it), and about my curiosity regarding the wishbone&#x2014;on and on I went, until Papa came forward and knelt before me, putting one hand on my shoulder and stopping me at last. <br> <br>&#x201c;You wanted to know how it worked?&#x201d; he asked. <br> <br>I nodded, not trusting myself to speak again lest the flood pick up where it had left off. <br> <br>He sighed. &#x201c;Your behaviour was not appropriate for a young lady. Do you understand that?&#x201d; I nodded. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s make certain you remember it, then.&#x201d; With one hand he turned me about, and with the other he administered three brisk smacks to my bottom that started the tears afresh. When I had myself under control once more, I found that he had left me to compose myself and gone to the wall of his study. The shelves there were lined with books, some, I fancied, weighing as much as I did myself. (This was pure fancy, of course; the weightiest book in my library now, my own <i>De draconum varietatibus,</i> weighs a mere ten pounds.) <br> <br>The volume he took down was much lighter, if rather thicker than one would normally give to a seven-year-old child. He pressed it into my hands, saying, &#x201c;Your lady mother would not be happy to see you with this, I imagine, but I had rather you learn it from a book than from experimentation. Run along, now, and don&#x2019;t show that to her.&#x201d; <br> <br>I curtseyed and fled. <br> <br>Like Greenie, that book still sits on my shelf. My father had given me Gotherham&#x2019;s <i>Avian Anatomy,</i> and though our understanding of the subject has improved a great deal since Gotherham&#x2019;s day, it was a good introduction for me at the time. The text was only half comprehensible to me, but I devoured the half I could understand and contemplated the rest in fascinated perplexity. Best of all were the diagrams, thin, meticulous drawings of avian skeletons and musculature. From this book I learned that the function of the wishbone (or, more properly, the <i>furcula</i>) is to strengthen the thoracic skeleton of birds and provide attachment points for wing muscles. <br> <br>It seemed so simple, so obvious: all birds had wishbones, because all birds flew. (At the time I was not aware of ostriches, and neither was Gotherham.) Hardly a brilliant conclusion in the field of natural history, but to me it was brilliant indeed, and opened up a world I had never considered before: a world in which one could observe patterns and their circumstances, and from these derive information not obvious to the unaided eye. <br> <br>Wings, truly, were my first obsession. I did not much discriminate in those days as to whether the wings in question belonged to a dove or a sparkling or a butterfly; the point was that these beings flew, and for that I adored them. I might mention, however, that although Mr. Gotherham&#x2019;s text concerns itself with birds, he does make the occasional, tantalizing reference to analogous structures or behaviours in dragonkind. Since (as I have said before) sparklings were then classed as a variety of insect, this might count as my first introduction to the wonder of dragons. <br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br> <br>I should speak at least in passing of my family, for without them I would not have become the woman I am today. <br> <br>Of my mother I expect you have some sense already; she was an upright and proper woman of her class, and did the best she could to teach me ladylike ways, but no one can achieve the impossible. Any faults in my character must not be laid at her feet. As for my father, his business interests kept him often from home, and so to me he was a more distant figure, and perhaps more tolerant because of it; he had the luxury of seeing my misbehaviours as charming quirks of his daughter&#x2019;s nature, while my mother faced the messes and ruined clothing those quirks produced. I looked upon him as one might upon a minor pagan god, earnestly desiring his goodwill, but never quite certain how to propitiate him. <br> <br>Where siblings are concerned, I was the fourth in a set of six children, and, as I have said, the only daughter. Most of my brothers, while of personal significance to me, will not feature much in this tale; their lives have not been much intertwined with my career. <br> <br>The exception is Andrew, whom I have already mentioned; he is the one from whom I pinched the penknife. He, more than any, was my earnest partner in all the things of which my mother despaired. When Andrew heard of my bloody endeavours behind the hayrick, he was impressed as only an eight-year-old boy can be, and insisted I keep the knife as a trophy of my deeds. That, I no longer have; it deserves a place of honor alongside Greenie and Gotherham, but I lost it in the swamps of Mouleen. Not before it saved my life, however, cutting me free of the vines in which my Labane captors had bound me, and so I am forever grateful to Andrew for the gift. <br> <br>I am also grateful for his assistance during our childhood years, exercising a boy&#x2019;s privileges on my behalf. When our father was out of town, Andrew would borrow books out of his study for my use. Texts I myself would never have been permitted thus found their way into my room, where I hid them between the mattresses and behind my wardrobe. My new maid had too great a terror of being found off her feet to agree to the old deal, but she was amenable to sweets, and so we settled on a new arrangement, and I read long into the night on more than one occasion. <br> <br>The books he took on my behalf, of course, were nearly all of natural history. My horizons expanded from their winged beginnings to creatures of all kinds: mammals and fish, insects and reptiles, plants of a hundred sorts, for in those days our knowledge was still general enough that one person might be expected to familiarize himself (or in my case, herself ) with the entire field. <br> <br>Some of the books mentioned dragons. They never did so in more than passing asides, brief paragraphs that did little more than develop my appetite for information. In several places, however, I came across references to a particular work: Sir Richard Edgeworth&#x2019;s <i>A Natural History of Dragons</i>. Carrigdon &amp; Rudge were soon to be reprinting it, as I learned from their autumn catalogue; I risked a great deal by sneaking into my father&#x2019;s study so as to leave that pamphlet open to the page announcing the reprint. It described <i>A Natural History of Dragons</i> as &#x201c;the most indispensable reference on dragonkind available in our tongue&#x201d;; surely that would be enough to entice my father&#x2019;s eye. <br> <br>My gamble paid off, for it was in the next delivery of books we received. I could not have it right away&#x2014;Andrew would not borrow anything our father had yet to read&#x2014;and I nearly went mad with waiting. Early in winter, though, Andrew passed me the book in a corridor, saying, &#x201c;He finished it yesterday. Don&#x2019;t let anyone see you with it.&#x201d; <br> <br>I was on my way to the parlor for my weekly lesson on the pianoforte, and if I went back up to my room I would be late. Instead I hurried onward, and concealed the book under a cushion mere heartbeats before my teacher entered. I gave him my best curtsy, and thereafter struggled mightily not to look toward the divan, from which I could feel the unread book taunting me. (I would say my playing suffered from the distraction, but it is difficult for something so dire to grow worse. Although I appreciate music, to this day I could not carry a tune if you tied it around my wrist for safekeeping.) <br> <br>Once I escaped from my lesson, I began in on the book straightaway, and hardly paused except to hide it when necessary. I imagine it is not so well-known today as it was then, having been supplanted by other, more complete works, so it may be difficult for my readers to imagine how wondrous it seemed to me at the time. Edgeworth&#x2019;s identifying criteria for &#x201c;true dragons&#x201d; were a useful starting point for many of us, and his listing of qualifying species is all the more impressive for having been assembled through correspondence with missionaries and traders, rather than through firsthand observation. He also addressed the issue of &#x201c;lesser dragonkind,&#x201d; namely, those creatures such as wyverns which failed one criterion or another, yet appeared (by the theories of the period) to be branches of the same family tree. <br> <br>The influence this book had upon me may be expressed by saying that I read it straight through four times, for once was certainly not enough.

Readers view his constant distress as Toriko encounters epic-sized challenges that encompass full-page images of the creatures and the battles that ensue. The book is filled with wordplay. The gabara is subdued with two weapons: a knife and...a fork, which are in reality special body attack positions.

Highly sophisticated and with a thoroughbred pedigree, they can, however, be overlooked by traders today. This should change with the long-awaited publication of this book. Jeremy du Plessis - one of the foremost Point and Figure experts in the world - has written what can truly be described as the definitive guide to the topic.For the first time this book thoroughly demystifies the world of Point and Figure charting, with a detailed explanation of the history and development of the technique from its invention to the modern day. The book covers the makeup of the chart patterns, why they are created, and their interpretation. Throughout, readers are encouraged to understand Point and Figure charts from first principles, rather than just remember the names of a series of patterns. It is the first major work for 50 years to discuss in depth the original 1-box reversal method of Point and Figure charting and contrast it with the more popular 3-box reversal method. Further, the explanation of how to use Point and Figure charts to project targets and calculate risk-reward ratios is the most comprehensive ever seen.Also covered in detail are: - A step-by-step analysis of the FTSE 100 Index using the 3-box method, as well as the NASDAQ Composite Index using the 1-box method.- A detailed discussion of optimising techniques.- Point and Figure&#39;s contribution to market breadth with bullish percent.- Lesser known, more advanced techniques such as the use of moving averages, parabolic SAR and Bollinger Bands on Point and Figure charts.All this is illustrated with numerous colour charts and observations from yearsof trading e</p><p>Jeremy du Plessis trained as an automotive engineer, then an economist, but gave them both up to become a Technical Analyst. In 1983 he founded Indexia Research and pioneered the development of PC based technical analysis software with the Indexia range of technical analysis systems. During the 1980s he developed a number of technical tools and indicators under the banner of Indexia, which are still used in software to this day. <p>He is an expert on Point and Figure charts, and the Indexia software was the first PC-based system to draw them correctly and clearly in the early 1980s. He lectures the Point and Figure module for the Society of Technical Analysts and sets the Point and Figure syllabus for the International Federation of Technical Analysts. He has taught Technical Analysis, and in particular Point and Figure, to thousands of professional traders and investors over the last 20 years. In 2001, after running Indexia Research for nearly 20 years, he agreed to merge the company with Updata plc, where he is now Head of Technical Analysis and the designer of the Updata Technical Analyst software. </p><p>He is a Fellow of the Society of Technical Analysts (FSTA) in the UK, and a member of the American Market Technicians Association (MTA). He is a holder of the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) designation awarded by the MTA.</p>"Rarely does a book live up to its claim of being the 'definitive' guide to something. Jeremy du Plessis' new book lives up that claim and more. It's almost impossible to imagine a more definitive treatment of point and figure charting. The author pays homage to its early development and the pioneers who first wrote about it. He gives extensive coverage to the original 1-point reversal method before moving on to the more modern methods. The subject is examined from every conceivable angle. I'm not aware of anyone who has even attempted to combine p&amp;f charting with so many modern technical indicators. I expect that du Plessis' book will not only become the definitive book on point and figure, but will also become a classic in the field of technical analysis." John Murphy CMT, Author of Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets "A superbly comprehensive book on this powerful technique from one of the world's leading experts on the subject. A must read for all serious technicians and investors." Adam Sorab, Chairman - UK Society of Technical Analysts "If you had to go to a desert island and were only allowed to take one investment tool with you, then it should be the Point and Figure chart. If you were also allowed to take only one book, other than the Bible and the works of Shakespeare, then make it this Definitive Guide by Jeremy du Plessis. The whole subject is covered from its early historical beginnings as a way of noting the noise of the ticker tape in the days of Charles Dow, then called the Book method, through its evolution to become the 'Voice of the market'. How to construct and use the charts and their unequivocally clear buy and sell signals, revelation of trend, reversal, support and resistance levels are all revealed and well illustrated. The subject is explained as an evidence gathering procedure, that leads to a successful trading method, with accurate entry, stop loss, and targets. It is also brought right up to date with with some new thinking involving indicators such as OBV, Bollinger bands, and parabolic stop and reverse signals. You will have such a great time working through it on your desert island that you might not want to come home." Robin Griffiths FSTA, Head of Asset Allocation, Rathbone Investment Management "Even though point and figure charting is 120 years old, Mr. du Plessis has brought a truly fresh and authoritative approach to a subject that is central to technical analysis. Bravo!" Bruce M. Kamich, CMT, Adjunct Professor of Finance at Baruch College, Past President of the Market Technicians Association "Not only does Mr. du Plessis plumb the history and elucidate the present state of point and figure analysis, he looks at a craft many regard as passe and sees a vibrant future.

A young man whose streak of luck ends dramatically in a major car crash. Followed by blackness. A long, long time in cold limbo.When he wakes up life has been turned upside down.

Now he has an ability to see into the future. An ability which will bring him into a terrifying confrontation with a charismatic, power-hungry and dangerous man ...</p><p>In the <i>St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost &amp; Gothic Writers</i>, Gary Westfahl predicts that "King has already earned himself a place in the history of literature.... At the very least, he will enjoy the status of a latter-day Anthony Trollope, an author respected for his popularity and social commentary.... More likely, he will be enshrined as the Charles Dickens of the late 20th century, the writer who perfectly reflected, encapsulated, and expressed the characteristic concerns of his era." <p> If any of King's novels exemplifies his skill at portraying the concerns of his generation, it's <i>The Dead Zone</i> (1979). Although it contains a horrific subplot about a serial killer, it isn't strictly a horror novel. It's the story of an unassuming high school teacher, an Everyman, who suffers a gap in time--like a Rip Van Winkle who blacks out during the years 1970-75--and thus becomes acutely conscious of the way that American society is rapidly changing. He wakes up as well with a gap in his brain, the "dead zone" of the title. The zone gives him crippling headaches, but also grants him second sight, a talent he doesn't want and is reluctant to use. The crux of the novel concerns whether he will use that talent to alter the course of history.</p><p> <i>The Dead Zone</i> is a tight, well-crafted book.

Hundreds of entries range from esoteric elements of Islamic and Christian history to arcane rituals practiced by Druids, Freemasons, alchemists, and other secret societies. 16 pages of color plates, 100 black-and-white illustrations.</p><p>The Philosophical Research Society is a nonprofit organization founded in 1934 for the purpose of assisting thoughtful persons to live more graciously and constructively in a confused and troubled world. The Society is entirely free from educational, political, or ecclesiastical control. Dedicated to an idealistic approach to the solution of human problems, the Society&#39;s program stresses the need for the integration of religion, philosophy, and the science of psychology into one system of instruction. The goal of this instruction is to enable the individual to develop a mature philosophy of life, to recognize his proper responsibilities and opportunities, and to understand and appreciate his place in the unfolding universal pattern.Mystical speculations about God, the world, and man occupied the minds of many medieval scholars and theologians. They conceived creation itself to be a symbol or figure through which the Divine Will manifested its purposes and intentions-thus by analogy, the world revealed God, and man revealed the world. The human being himself was a microcosm-a miniature of the cosmos. After the collapse of the pagan cultural institutions, it was unlawful to teach classical learning or to advance scientific knowledge contrary to the prevailing scholasticism. To avoid persecution and at the same time perpetuate for the benefit of qualified disciples the more advanced formulas of the ancient wisdom, the sacred truths were presented symbolically through the beautiful engraved devices of the emblem writers. <p>The seventeenth century restoration of learning gradually brought about a Universal Reformation as proclaimed in the Fama of the Rosicrucians. A careful study of the emblem books of that period reveals that most of the figures and designs were based upon Egyptian or Greek mythology, and like the alchemical symbols, perpetuated the secret teachings of esoteric fraternities. Today, those well informed in the Orphic Mysteries and the mystical speculations of the Neoplatonists can interpret the design with little difficulty. It appears that the emblem books were, in many cases, actual extensions of Pythagorean and Platonic metaphysics. Paracelsus said that the first hieroglyphic book is nature, published in folio, and the second hieroglyphic book is man, published in duodecimo. </p><p>To live in the world without becoming aware of the meaning of the world is like wandering about in a great library without touching the books. It has always seemed to me that symbolism should be restored to the structure of world education. The young are no longer invited to seek the hidden truths, dynamic and eternal, locked within the shapes and behavior of living beings. </p><p>The present volume is itself a symbol made up of many symbols gathered from rare sources. It invites the thoughtful reader to explore the meanings of these emblems and devices with his own insight. Because spiritual growth is the goal of all human aspiration, symbols that help us to grow are precious things for they open the doors to life everlasting. </p><p>I wish to express my deep indebtedness to those faithful artists and engravers whose remarkable meditation pictures have guided my labors for so many years. This book is dedicated to the truths they served and the wonderful designs which they have bestowed as a priceless heritage upon the truth seekers of the future. It is my sincere hope that this memorial may continue to serve and inspire new generations of kindly and dedicated people. </p><p>Manly P.

Liebling (1904-1963) was a formidable eater and a remarkable man, and his nostalgic recitation of his years and meals in Paris is a pleasure to read, dream on, and drool about.<p> Liebling treasured a good appetite as a prerequisite for writing about food, as his accounts of substantial meals (two portions of cassoulet, one steak topped with beef marrow, and a dozen or so oysters, for example) attest. For the poised, precise, literary, and humorous flavor of his writing, you need only crack open the book--any page will do. Liebling recounts how to dine superbly without being lead astray by too much money, and he digresses magnificently on the evils of abstemiousness ("No sane man can afford to dispense with debilitating pleasures; no ascetic can be considered reliably sane"). In this age of diets and pragmatic health care, it's refreshing to read such an inspired and inspiring ode to pleasure. As a means of savoring a love affair with Paris, sparking an interest in a trip to France, restructuring your priorities for the trip you've already planned, or gearing up on the flight over for the gastronomic debauches to come, Liebling is unsurpassed. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p><p><b>A.J. Liebling</b> joined the staff of The New Yorker in 1935, where his "Wayward Press" columns became a model of fine journalistic writing.

Though she wrote stories from the time she was a child, Gripe did not publish her first book until she was thirty-one. Her first notable success came in the 1960s with a trilogy of books about Hugo and Josephine, and in 1964 she published <i>Glasblï¿½sarns barn</i>, translated into English as <i>The Glassblower&#x2019;s Children </i>in 1973.

By the author of Rain Storm. 50,000 first printing.</p><p><p><b>Introduction to the New Edition</b></p><p>Every time I write a new book in a series, I begin by asking what happened to the characters in the previous book, and build on that. When I started <i>A Lonely Resurrection</i>, for example, the second Rain book, I asked myself, "What would Rain do now that his archenemy Yamaoto and the CIA have tracked him down in Tokyo? What would Tatsu, of the Japanese National Police Force, do with the disk full of incriminating political information Rain acquired for him? And what about Midori, Rain's lover, whose father Rain killed? Would she really believe Rain was dead? What would she do if she suspected the truth?" </p><p>Similarly, to discover the story in <i>Winner Take All</i>, the third book, I asked, "Did Rain manage to disappear in Brazil as he was planning in <i>A Lonely Resurrection</i>? Did he reconnect in Rio with his new love interest, Naomi Nascimento? What post-nine-eleven plans would CIA operative Kanezaki have for Rain, and how would he track Rain down outside in Japan?" </p><p>But I think my favorite example of how each book builds on the events of the previous one is Redemption Games. Here's what happened. </p><p>At the end of <i>Winner Take All</i> (spoiler alert!), Rain is stunned to learn that he can trust former Marine sniper Dox, who was sent to kill Rain but wound up working with him, and indeed saving his life, instead. This realization ruptures Rain's conviction that he can trust no one, rely on no one -- a conviction that's central to his self-image and his whole worldview. I knew this change had to be central to the new story, but I wasn't sure how. I mentioned what I was grappling with to my friend Marc MacYoung of NoNonsenseSelfDefense.com (nnsd.com). Marc said, "Ah, you need to talk to Terry Trahan." I knew Terry from NNSD's listserv and from having trained with him a bit at one of the annual NNSD barbecues, but I didn't know his story. Marc put us in touch, and Terry generously answered my many questions. </p><p>What he told me was fascinating. A former street criminal and veteran of countless violent encounters, Terry was working as a bouncer when he started dating a woman who has since become his wife. He didn't know why this woman would love a criminal like him, but he decided he wanted to be worthy of her love. He wanted to get out of the life. And he started trying to do so. But he was still bouncing, and then one night, while he was struggling with the imbalance of living with one foot still in the life and one foot out of it, he was faced with a routine confrontation in the bar. Just something with an unruly patron, the kind of thing he had successfully handled dozens of times before. But this time, Terry froze. </p><p>Fortunately, the encounter ended without lasting damage for Terry, and he learned something profound from it&#x2014;something he shared with me. Which is how vulnerable a person can be during the transition from one kind of life to another. As he described all this to me, I could feel that light bulb go on over my head&#x2014;"Of course! That's exactly what happens to Rain. His worldview is all messed up because of how Dox saved him, he gets hired for a new job, and... he freezes! He blows the hit! And then whoever hired him comes after him as a way of cleaning up the mess Rain has caused..." </p><p>Which, like all good ideas, immediately led to all the right questions: "Okay, who hired Rain? Maybe the Israelis? Yes, there was more than a hint of that possibility in <i>Winner Take All</i>, where Rain crosses paths&#x2014;and swords&#x2014; with gorgeous Mossad agent Delilah, who's destined to become his lover. Okay, who would the Mossad want Rain to kill? And why? And how would Dox be involved?" </p><p>How indeed?

Winter can last a lifetime. And the struggle for the Iron Throne has begun. From the fertile south, where heat breeds conspiracy, to the vast and savage eastern lands, all the way to the frozen north, kings and queens, knights and renegades, liars, lords and honest men . . . all will play the Game of Thrones.</p><p>Readers of epic fantasy series are: (1) patient--they are left in suspense between each volume, (2) persistent--they reread or at least review the previous book(s) when a new installment comes out, (3) strong--these 700-page doorstoppers are <i>heavy</i>, and (4) mentally agile--they follow a host of characters through a myriad of subplots. In <i>A Game of Thrones</i>, the first book of a projected six, George R.R. Martin rewards readers with a vividly real world, well-drawn characters, complex but coherent plotting, and beautifully constructed prose, which <i>Locus</i> called "well above the norms of the genre." <p> Martin's Seven Kingdoms resemble England during the Wars of the Roses, with the Stark and Lannister families standing in for the Yorks and Lancasters. The story of these two families and their struggle to control the Iron Throne dominates the foreground; in the background is a huge, ancient wall marking the northern border, beyond which barbarians, ice vampires, and direwolves menace the south as years-long winter advances. Abroad, a dragon princess lives among horse nomads and dreams of fiery reconquest.</p><p> There is much bloodshed, cruelty, and death, but <i>A Game of Thrones</i> is nevertheless compelling; it garnered a Nebula nomination and won the 1996 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel. So, on to <i>A Clash of Kings</i>! <i>--Nona Vero</i></p>Long ago, in a time long forgotten, a mysterious event threw the seasons of the world out of balance.

His victories in battle are unerring. unerring means that he acts where victory is certain, and conquers an enemy that has already lost.</i><p>&#x2014;SUN TZU<br></p> <p><i>How to Rule the World from Your Couch</i> is meant to inspire you to be fully aware, conscious, active, dynamic, and alive in every single moment of your life. Much of this can be done in your pajamas, in total comfort, from wherever you want to be and with the people you want to be with, as you move through what we all know as &#x201c;normal life.&#x201d; The &#x201c;normal life&#x201d; <i>you</i> want. You do not have to be full of get-up-and-go to have success, find love, or earn a living. There are tools, innate tools that permit you to do much of the heavy lifting without your feet even touching the floor. </p><p>For more than twenty years, I have used and taught these tools to make businesses stronger, to help people find love, heal their own bodies, communicate with loved ones from afar, talk to their children when their children were unwilling to listen, to make better decisions to change the future in the immediate present, and to help people understand how to create their own dreams. Some of these dreams seemed impossible to achieve at the outset. From challenges such as these, techniques were developed to create dazzling results in less time with less work. As I will explain, most of the techniques can be initiated from your couch&#x2014;by using every human being&#x2019;s ability to utilize the common field in which we all live to transmit and receive information and motivation and to build a reality that others share. In these pages are the compiled experiences of what works. Many of these practices will not fit into your concept of reality. Try them first, and then judge for yourself. Good scientists are always skeptics, but they do not allow their skepticism to keep them from committing 100 percent to a hypothesis. Commit yourself 100 percent for the length of a single exercise, and then, like a good scientist, document everything. You will be astounded by the results that you are able to create. </p><p>Living as we do in a culture of &#x201c;experts,&#x201d; my greatest pleasure is to make you become your own best expert. In doing so, you also become an expert for your families, friends, companies, and culture. Pardon the clichï¿½, but together, we really can create a better world. This world really, truly starts from your personal and individual experience&#x2014;your very own power and ability to create the world that you want. When you know how easy it is to create this unique world, what is born is not insatiable desire, but rather unstoppable generosity. </p><p>I am an introvert. Although I have now, after fifty years of life, trained myself to look comfortable and animated in public, I am my happiest and most productive on my couch, surrounded by my life and loved ones, where, in my own domain of peace, I can direct my intuitive ability to create and direct the changes that I want, as well as attract the things/people/experiences I want without having to go out into the world. I am now thankful to be gifted in skills that allow me to have a full life, replete with friends, love, work, and entertainment, which is all made possible, for the most part, right from my couch. Now I pass down these skills to you. </p><p>In my first book, <i>Practical Intuition,</i> I presented practical techniques to help readers develop their intuitive abilities. In my next two books, <i>Practical Intuition for Success</i> and <i>Practical Intuition in Love,</i> I showed readers how to apply these techniques in their professional and romantic lives, while developing a variety of advanced intuitive skills such as telepathy and precognition. In <i>How to Rule the World from Your Couch,</i> I introduce and explain the various levels on which pure intuition can operate and demonstrate how they are always applicable and alive&#x2014;even when (especially when!) you&#x2019;re just sitting there. </p><p>Let me hit you with something else: Have you ever experienced, in a fully visceral, soul-talking-directly-to-you kind of way, a shockingly clear, unbelievably useful piece of intuitive information, a tiny morsel of data that you simply, for the life of you, could not explain away? Have you ever just <i>known</i> something not just because you <i>knew</i> it, but more because you <i>sensed</i> it? Many of my students and clients (from doctors, engineers, and market analysts to businesspeople of all varieties, scientists, lawyers, and beyond) have come to their own sense of intuition just this way&#x2014;through some unexplainable flash of insight, or perhaps triggered by something I said that worked for them. Regardless of how or under what circumstances it occurs, when tapped into purely, intuition and insight become the breath of life. My clients may have been skeptical, but as pragmatists, they knew they could not ignore what they themselves had experienced firsthand. I believe that intuitively they knew they had tapped into a new way of navigating. This sense made them hungry to know more and perhaps even led them to me. Though they may still be skeptics, guess what: they use these skills regularly anyway. </p><p>Sun Tzu, the ancient Chinese military sage, said, &#x201c;Every battle is won before it is ever fought&#x201d;&#x2014;and this wise and profound message is exactly what this book is about. Engaging in battle is a waste of time. Goals can be achieved and, in fact, are achieved effectively only when you use your intuition to map the way before you start the journey, anticipating and avoiding obstacles, arriving at landmarks in the right order with proper timing, and, when you can, following the scenic route. </p><p>We live in a world of constant activity, always doing, in motion, on task. The reality is that your truest successes come not only from what you <i>do,</i> but more so from your preparedness and ability to gather needed information in advance. The doing piece is actually tiny, but only if you have laid down the proper foundation of readiness. Everything is available. Your only task at hand is to position yourself properly to receive it. Think of yourself as a perfectly designed state-of-the-art radio. You may be able to send and receive all the right signals&#x2014;but only if your power is on. </p><p>Everything you learn in this book will make your decisions better, your relationships stronger, your actions more effective, and your life easier. Each of these abilities can become part and parcel of every decision you make. You will notice that as you hone your intuition, you will be engaged in a lot of inner work. Try to remember that your subconscious can use your intuition to punish you, just as it can attempt to help you. That is why it is so important to be as conscious of your process and motivation as possible, which is why I believe documentation of your work is critical. Remember that you have the ability, through intuition, to know what is coming and how to prepare. Your history, patterns, areas of self-sabotage, reactions, and even your beliefs are what cause you to take the painful path, ignore the obvious, and create bothersome or even disastrous challenges. Think of it this way: even in the most war-torn countries there are people who survive and thrive and help others do the same&#x2014;and they are the truest intuitives among us. </p><p>The goal of this book is to make me, and books like this, obsolete. As you work through each chapter, you will find that your intuition will start to give you a more accurate view of your targets, and you will become a clearer, more powerful, and more direct person. Intuition itself, as I will explain, gives you the power, the questions, and the answers. It gives you the tools to create, to change, and to teach others, as well as the ability to be taught effectively by those around you. The main problem that everyone seems to share is the inability to understand that <i>less</i> work can yield <i>more</i> results. By &#x201c;work,&#x201d; I mean the energy that we expend on the wrong things, creating the layers of complexity that we (as human beings with elaborate psyches) tend to (unconsciously) add to the different scenarios in our lives. Think about it: how can adding complexity to a situation possibly be effective? For this reason, I don&#x2019;t advocate the &#x201c;no pain no gain&#x201d; philosophy of life. Pain consumes time, energy, resources, and attention. I hope for you to be able to refine your intuition to simplify, enrich, and energize your life, so that reaching your goals becomes an organic part of living every day. </p><p>The problem is that we are not even conscious half the time that we are adding complexity to our lives, but as you will see, by learning to access our intuition we can start to clear the fog of these self-imposed challenges. In this way, we can learn to simplify the complex in order to find the shortest or most pleasurable line between you and your goals&#x2014;whatever they may be. </p><p>Intuition, you see, is innate. It is part of our human hard-wiring, to the point that two-year-olds rely on it to survive and accomplish incredible things, mostly because they do not yet have access to things like intellect, wisdom, or experience. Intuition is so simple that if you merely do the exercises at the beginning of each chapter (even without first reading the chapter), over time, through firsthand experience your intuition will start to fill in some of the blanks. I, as your guide through this process, have created and organized a program of experiences and tools in the form of the book&#x2019;s chapters to speed up your subconscious process&#x2014;but it is for the sole purpose of helping you to access and allow your intuition to take over. You will see that as you start to let go of the <i>thinking</i>, and actually start <i>intuiting,</i> you will...</p></p><h2>Rowan and the Keeper of the Crystal (Rowan of Rin #3)</h2><p><p>Rowan and his mother have been called to Maris to choose the new Keeper of the seaside village's precious Crystal, a dangerous task Rowan's family has been bound to for generations.</p><p>But this time, something goes terribly wrong. Rowan's mother is poisoned and near death, and Rowan must find the antidote, outwit a deadly sea serpent, and pick a new Keeper -- before it's too late.</p></p><p><p>Emily Rodda has written many books for children, including <em>Finders Keepers,</em> which School Library journal dubbed "a lively adventure," and several novels about the likable hero Rowan. The first of these novels, <em>Rowan of Rin, </em>won the Children's Book Council of Australia Book of the Year for Younger Readers Award when it was first published. In fact, Emily Rodda has won the Children's Book Council of Australia Book of the Year Award an unprecedented five times. A former editor, Ms. Rodda is also the best-selling author of adult mysteries under the name Jennifer Rowe. She lives in Australia.</p>Grade 4-6-In this third book in the series, Rowan and his mother journey to the Maris folk on the coast so that she can choose the new Keeper of the Crystal, who will lead the Maris when the old Keeper dies. His mother knows that death is a distinct possibility but must fulfill her duty or else the Crystal will die and the Maris will no longer be protected against attack from the Zebak. When she is poisoned, Rowan breaks a 1000-year-old tradition by refusing to choose a candidate using the customary tests. He insists that the three candidates accompany him to an island to get the rare ingredients for an antidote to the poison. With their reluctant aid, he gathers what he needs, though it means plunging into one peril after another. Having survived both savage beasts and deadly political intrigues, he has one more test in store, for at the last possible instant, he realizes that the newly chosen Keeper has been bespelled by the Zebak. In this suspenseful, clever story, Rodda gives her young hero a generous supply of courage and wit, which proves helpful when he is faced with a series of catastrophes.

In <i>Just Babies</i>, Paul Bloom argues that humans are in fact hardwired with a sense of morality. Drawing on groundbreaking research at Yale, Bloom demonstrates that, even before they can speak or walk, babies judge the goodness and badness of others&#x2019; actions; feel empathy and compassion; act to soothe those in distress; and have a rudimentary sense of justice.<br><br>Still, this innate morality is limited, sometimes tragically. We are naturally hostile to strangers, prone to parochialism and bigotry. Bringing together insights from psychology, behavioral economics, evolutionary biology, and philosophy, Bloom explores how we have come to surpass these limitations. Along the way, he examines the morality of chimpanzees, violent psychopaths, religious extremists, and Ivy League professors, and explores our often puzzling moral feelings about sex, politics, religion, and race. <br>In his analysis of the morality of children and adults, Bloom rejects the fashionable view that our moral decisions are driven mainly by gut feelings and unconscious biases. Just as reason has driven our great scientific discoveries, he argues, it is reason and deliberation that makes possible our moral discoveries, such as the wrongness of slavery. Ultimately, it is through our imagination, our compassion, and our uniquely human capacity for rational thought that we can transcend the primitive sense of morality we were born with, becoming more than just babies.<br><br>Paul Bloom has a gift for bringing abstract ideas to life, moving seamlessly from Darwin, Herodotus, and Adam Smith to <i>The Princess Bride</i>, Hannibal Lecter, and Louis C.K. Vivid, witty, and intellectually probing, <i>Just Babies </i>offers a radical new perspective on our moral lives.</p></p><p><p><b></b></p><p><b>A Conversation with Paul Bloom, Author of <i>Just Babies</i> </b></p><p></p> <p><strong>Q) What&#x2019;s up with the title?</strong></p> <p>A) It&#x2019;s meant to be playful, because it has two quite different meanings. <i>Just Babies</i> can express a reasonable skepticism about the abilities of these tiny creatures&#x2014;what do you expect of them, they&#x2019;re just babies? But of course &#x201c;just&#x201d; also derives from justice&#x2014;as in &#x201c;a just society&#x201d;&#x2014;and so the title captures one of the main arguments of the book, which is that we are born as moral creatures. We start off as <i>just</i> babies. I know this sounds like a remarkable claim, but I hope that my book will convince people to take it seriously. </p> <p><strong>Q) What made you choose to write this book at this moment?</strong></p> <p>A) These are exciting times for anyone interested in morality. There are major developments in areas like social neuroscience, evolutionary theory, and moral philosophy. And several research teams&#x2014;including my own at Yale&#x2014;are making surprising discoveries about the moral lives of babies and children. I think that now, perhaps for the first time in history, we have scientifically informed answers to some of the questions that matter most: How is it that we are capable of transcendent kindness&#x2014;and unspeakable cruelty? How do evolution, culture, parenting, and religion conspire to shape our moral natures? How do we make sense of people&#x2019;s strongly held opinions about abortion, gay marriage, affirmative action, and torture? And how can we become better people? <i>Just Babies</i> tries to answer these questions.</p> <p><strong>Q) How can you even study morality in babies? </strong></p> <p>A) In most of our own studies, we use puppet shows. We show babies characters who interact in certain ways&#x2014;such as one individual helping another or one individual hitting another&#x2014;and then see who the babies want to interact with, who they want to reward, and who they want to punish. Using these methods, we have discovered that even young babies have the capacity for moral judgment.</p> <p><strong>Q)So are babies naturally good, or naturally evil?</strong></p> <p>A) Both! We are born with empathy and compassion, the capacity to judge the actions of others, and a rudimentary understanding of justice and fairness. Morality is bred in the bone. But there is a nastier side to our natures as well. There&#x2019;s a lot of evidence that even the youngest babies carve the world into Us versus Them&#x2014;and they are strongly biased to favor the Us. We are very tribal beings. Our natures are not just kind; they are also cruel and selfish. We favor those who look like us and are naturally cold-blooded towards strangers.</p> <p><strong>Q) Does this mean that prejudice and racism are inevitable?</strong></p> <p>A) Happily, no. For one thing, social experience really matters&#x2014;babies and children have to learn who Us versus Them is by observing how those around them act. So while some distinctions are inevitable, such as friends versus strangers, others are not. Notably, it only pretty late in development&#x2014;by about the age of five&#x2014;that some children come to use skin color and similar cues when decide who to befriend and who to prefer. Before this, they don&#x2019;t know that race matters, and so whether or not children will be racist is dependent on how they are raised; what sort of social environments they find themselves in.</p> <p>Also, we are smart critters, smart enough to override our impulses and biases when we think they are inappropriate. Once we learn about these ugly aspects of our nature, we can move to combat them. We can create treaties and international organizations aimed at protecting universal human rights. We can employ procedures such as blind reviewing and blind auditions that are designed to prevent judges from being biased, consciously or unconsciously, by a candidate&#x2019;s race&#x2014;or anything other than what is under evaluation.</p> <p><strong>Q) It seems as if a lot of your interest is in how we come to transcend our hard-wired morality.</strong></p> <p>A) That&#x2019;s right. A complete theory of morality has to have two parts. It starts with what we are born with, and this is surprisingly rich. But a critical part of our morality&#x2014;so much of what makes us human&#x2014;is not the product of evolution, but emerges over the course of human history and individual development. It is the product of our compassion, our imagination, and our magnificent capacity for reason. We bring all that to bear when we consider such questions as: How much should we give to charity? Is it right to eat meat? Are there any sorts of consensual sex acts that are morally wrong?</p> <p><strong>Q) What do you want to accomplish with this book?</strong></p> <p>A) Two things. First, many people believe that we are born selfish and amoral&#x2014;that we start off as natural-born psychopaths. And many argue that we are, as David Hume put it, slaves of the passions: our moral judgments and moral actions are the product of neural mechanisms that we have no awareness of and no conscious control over. Intelligence and wisdom are largely impotent. This is an ugly view of human nature. Now, if it were true, we should buck up and learn to leave with it. But it&#x2019;s not true; these dismissive claims are refuted by everyday experience, by history, and by the science of developmental psychology. We are moral animals, and we are powerfully influenced by our capacity for reason.</p> <p>Second, I think there are practical implications to the scientific study of morality. If you&#x2019;re interested in reducing racism and bigotry, for instance, it is critical to understand our inborn proclivity to favor our own group over others; if you want to create a just society, you&#x2019;ll want to learn about how we naturally think about fairness and equity. Good social policy is informed by an understanding of human nature at its best and its worst, and this is what <i>Just Babies</i> is all about.</p><p><b>Paul Bloom </b>is the Brooks and Suzanne Ragen Professor of Psychology at Yale University.

The original 13-vol. set, published in Germany in the late 1960s, is internationally renowned for its scientific reporting, coverage and illustrations, and serves as a major point of reference for researchers and students studying the animal kingdom. Thorough articles familiarize readers with animals found everywhere on the globe, detailing their life cycles, predators, food systems, overall ecology and much more. Staying true to the original scientific pedigree, Gale enlisted prominent advisors and contributors from the international scientific community to incorporate recent developments in the animal world. Our new editions of <em>Grzimeks Animal Life Encyclopedia</em> are sure to serve the needs of students at every academic level.</p></p><p>*Starred Review* "Enjoyable reading" is not usually a phrase used in descriptions of encyclopedias, yet these four volumes of the second edition of <i>Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia</i> provide just that. Part of a 17-volume rewrite of the original 13-volume edition published beginning in 1967, these volumes exhibit excellence in writing, organization, illustration, and editing. <p>Following an extensive six- to nine-chapter overview, organization is taxonomical. Each family or order is discussed in terms of general description, evolution, structure and function, distribution, habitat, behavior, feeding, reproduction, conservation status, and relationship to humans. These descriptions are generally followed by anywhere from 2 to 20 representative species accounts that include rich illustrations and range maps. Formatting and layout are similar in all of the volumes, making the set consistent and easy to use. Illustrations, photos, and maps are in full color, serving the needs and expectations of today's readers. Editing of the volumes is tight, yielding uniform entries written by numerous expert contributors.</p><p>Volume 4 and volume 5--<i>Fishes 1</i> and <i>Fishes 2--</i> open with an elegant explanation of the diversity of the superclass <i>Pisces</i> and the difficulty of giving a general definition for all fish. Treatment is thorough despite the complexity of the topic caused by the sheer numbers of families, species, and habitats. Volume 6, <i>Amphibians,</i> includes introductory chapters on larvae and an expanded section on the early evolution and fossil history of amphibians. Volume 7, <i>Reptiles,</i> is the strongest of these excellent volumes. The contributors' expert knowledge and love of reptiles is evident. The "Order: Crocodilians" section is particularly well written.</p><p>Indexing is good in all volumes, giving access to both taxonomic and common names. Bibliographic references and further readings are well chosen and current. Recommended Web sites are authoritative and well cited. Criticism of these volumes is minor but must include the observation that the glossaries are on the scanty side. Examples of significant terms that should have been included in the glossary for <i>Reptiles</i> include <i>envenomated, hibernaculum, vomeronasal, vomerofaction</i>, <i>TSD</i> (temperature dependent sex determination), and <i>GSD</i> (genetic sex determination). The scientific illustrations are extremely well done, and the illustrations and photos are present in just the right amount--there when needed yet not intruding on the text. The addition of some minor cross-referencing of page numbers between the species/family accounts and the in-text illustrations and maps would be helpful.</p><p>These volumes are recommended for academic and larger public libraries. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

He lives in New York and Los Angeles.Amphetamine fiction is alive and writhing in Indiana's ninth book, a caper novel of life on the grift. The narrative follows the exploits of a truly memorable villain called (among other aliases) Evangeline, a lowlife spawn of the Vegas mire (maybe) who rises from her station by sheer mania and depraved indifference to anyone around her. Based on real-life murderer Santee Kimes, Evangeline is a monster, "so compulsive she grifts herself when she runs out of other people." Her career was launched in the Vietnam era when she married a crooked real estate developer named Warren Slote. Now an apathetic has-been drinking himself to death, Warren watches with detached amusement as Evangeline tries to take him to the cleaners. Evangeline's desire is to live as a self-styled queen, and she usually takes her marks (their identities, assets, lives and all) while looking for ways to set up tacky palaces on someone else's tab. The novel, with its Vegas roots, its run-on sentences and gut-wrenching displays of venality, is a hyperkinetic depiction of unbridled greed, the American dream's septic tank. But the book's lightning jumps backward and forward through time, its ever-changing POVs and often confusing plot make its course too convoluted. This is the third of Indiana's recent works inspired by real-life crimes (Resentment took off on the Menendez trial, and Three Month Fever was a "nonfiction" novel about the killer of Gianni Versace). The blatant villainy of Santee Kimes and her son, Kenneth, have spawned a public avid for an interpretation of their sociopathic behavior. This novel is too complex and confusing to attract tabloid readers, but Indiana's fans will probably speed through it, focusing on some of the most hideous characters ever to congeal in the form. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Secret Six Vol. 2: The Gauntlet</h2><p>The magic is gone.<br> &nbsp;<br> Something has sucked all arcane energies out of our world, leaving every practitioner of the occult arts in the dark and our entire dimension defenseless against an invasion by the Elder Gods beyond.

It was produced as a result of more than ten years&#39; extensive research, during which Dubin photographed artefacts and interviewed tribal elders and Native American artists. Providing an overview of American Indian jewellery and adornment, the book has many illustrations of distinctive objects from across the continent, together with a text that traces the development of forms and styles across regional and cultural boundaries.</p><p>Lois Sherr Dubin is the author of Abrams' highly regarded international success <i>The History of Beads</i>, acclaimed as the definitive study on the subject. She lives in New York City.Don't waste time reading this review; order this book now for whatever kind of library you may have. This big, beautiful, knock-your-socks-off title covers not only Native American adornment but also its history, the uses of materials, the spiritual meaning, the archaeology and oral traditions, and the artists. As treated here, adornment means not just jewelry but robes and headdresses, horse decoration, masks, and more. Modern work holds its own with the ancient in dazzling photographs, and occasional fold-out pages show staggering displays on themes such as beadwork as seen in Northwest Coast bracelets. Dubin (The History of Beads) follows themes as they develop, such as pictographic details used throughout the history of a tribe. There has not been such a broad and informative book before, and this will likely become the standard reference. Recommended for all libraries.AGay Neale, Southside Virginia Community Coll.

How does it happen that a century of foreign trade and missionary evangelism, of modern education and the training of Chinese students in Western ways, has now resulted in a seeming rejection of the West? What has been the real nature of "China's response to the West" during the past century of our contact?</p><p>This volume gives the first inside account, on so broad a scale, of how China's leaders reacted to the invasion of Western arms and goods, persons and ideas, during the three generations from the Opium War to the rise of the Kuomintang. In 28 chapters, with translations of 65 key documents, the authors trace the stages by which the scholar-officials of the Middle Kingdom were brought to recognize successively the need for Western arms to defend their country, Western technology for making arms, modern science to support technology, its application in modern industry to strengthen the nation, and all the attendant new ideas which led them eventually into great movements for institutional reform, political revolution, and ideological reconstruction.</p><p>From the famous Commissioner un's first study of Western geography during his anti-opium crusade, through the efforts of Li Hungchang and others at "self-strengthening" by industrialization, down to the critical thought of Dr. Hu Shih and the eclecticism of Sun Yat-sen in the early 20th century, the writings of China's leaders ring the changes on a central theme how to remake their heritage and create a modern nation capable of meeting the West on equal terms. The provincial viceroys, the Reformers of 1898, the Boxers in 1900, the old Empress Dowager, and the eager students studying abroad, each in their own way, all grapple with this absorbing problem. The varied Chinese responses to the West in the formative century here analyzed give us a new insight into the springs of social action among one-fifth of mankind.</p><p>The companion volume, for the research specialist, provides Notes and Sources, Bibliography, and a Glossary of Chinese names and terms, essential bases for further exploration of this new field.</p></p><p><p>John King Fairbank was Francis Lee Higginson Professor of History and Director of the East Asian Research Center at Harvard University.</p>&#x201c;A fascinating and highly important book...

In fact, Ball Four has been selected by the NY Public Library as one of the Books of the Century. And David Halberstam writes: a book deep in the American Vein, so deep in fact that is by no means a sports book. Bouton has written a baseball book about the reality of the game. Thirty years after its publication, it remains as wonderful to read as ever. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></p><p>As a player, former hurler Jim Bouton did nothing half-way; he threw so hard he'd lose his cap on almost every pitch. In the early '70s, he tossed off one of the funniest, most revealing, insider's takes on baseball life in <i>Ball Four,</i> his diary of the season he tried to pitch his way back from oblivion on the strength of a knuckler. The real curve, though, is Bouton's honesty. He carves humans out of heroes, and shines a light into the game's corners. A quarter century later, Bouton's unique baseball voice can still bring the heat.For the new edition of this historic book, Jim Bouton has written a highly entertaining epilogue, reflecting upon his life at the age of 60, the traumatic death of his daughter, and the heartwarming invitation from the Yankees to play in his first Old-Timers&#x2019; Day game since his exile from the club. Says the author about his ground-breaking book, "By establishing new boundaries, Ball Four changed sports reporting at least to the extent that, after the book, it was no longer possible to sell the milk and cookies image again. Besides, you can get sick on milk and cookies." Ball Four is a high-and-inside fastball that will forever be a journalistic classic.</p><h2>Edith Head&#39;s Hollywood</h2><p>Winner of eight Oscars for costume design, the author describes some of the hundreds of productions she worked on and gives her personal impressions of the actors and actresses for whom she created costumes</p><p></p><h2>Superman Unchained (The New 52)</h2><p>Decades before the Last Son of Krypton became Earth's champion, another being of incredible power fell from the sky.

Captured by the Grand Enchanter, the Golden Snail must obey his commands for 100 years, after which it is banished to the Ends of the Earth until a new master can claim it by reciting the magical spell. Wilbur decides to find the Golden Snail, and, packing an odd assortment of things, he and his faithful cat set off in a small sailboat. The story follows the pattern of many traditional folktales. As Wilbur travels, he comes upon creatures in need of help. Though he feels he is being distracted from his mission, his kind heart prevails, and each of those odd items proves to be just what's needed. His watering can helps quench the thirst of the wilting blossoming butterfly bush, etc. In turn, each rescued creature comes to Wilbur's aid when he is in trouble. With his mission finally accomplished, Wilbur decides it is better to be a Gallant Captain than a Grand Enchanter. While the story is nothing new, the telling is fresh, with many original and inventive touches, and Base's writing is well-paced and lively. The real standout is the artwork: well-composed, large paintings that are rich in detail but never look cluttered. As is usual with Base, there is a game to be played, this time finding a golden snail and crossbones in each picture. This beautiful book is sure to be a hit with the author's fans and cultivate new ones.<i>Grace Oliff, Ann Blanche Smith School, Hillsdale, NJ</i><br>ï¿½ Copyright 2010.

In a sweeping tour through Mexico, England, Ireland, Scotland, and beyond, she takes readers to dark glens and abandoned forests, ancient sacred sites, and local pubs, seeking people who might still believe in the elusive beings we call faeries. As Pike attempts to connect with the spirit world-and reconnect with her sense of wonder and purpose-she comes to view both herself and the world around her in a profoundly new light. <br><br> Captivating, full of heart, and unabashedly whimsical, <i>Faery Tale</i> is more than a memoir-it's the story of rekindling that spark of belief that makes even the most skeptical among us feel like a child again.</p><p>Signe Pike is an editor and writer living in Charleston, South Carolina.I wake up every morning with a sense of purpose: I am a tastemaker. As a book editor in New York City, I think about it constantly: What do people want to read? What will they want to read in one year? What about two? Mostly I acquire books that entertain women, that engulf them. When I think about the reader, I think about you. I buy books that I hope will make you smile, make you believe in the magic of love at first sight&#x2014;I buy books that I hope will heal your heartbreak. I read all the time, big, thick manuscripts. It&#x2019;s part of the job. Each night I take home chunks of pages in an extra shoulder bag. I read on the treadmill. I read while I&#x2019;m eating my take-out dinner. I read before bed, propped up with a pillow, my glasses slipping down toward the tip of my nose. I&#x2019;m beginning to wonder if carrying all the paper is the reason my right shoulder feels like it&#x2019;s filled with marbles. <p>In the morning I get up and I flip on the radio. NPR and a cup of coffee. I&#x2019;m always running late&#x2014;I can never figure out what to wear.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m almost twenty-eight years old and I&#x2019;m always trying to look older. I hate blazers and button-up shirts. I hate walking the streets of New York in high heels; the men gawk and the concrete wears them down until the metal pokes out the bottom. I lock the door and say goodbye to the cat, hoping for her that today, there will be pigeons. </p><p>I read on the subway, pressed up against a big man whose breath smells like rotten eggs and stale coffee. Next to me is a fat, middle-aged stockbroker, staring over the top of his <i>Wall Street Journal</i> at the gap between the taught fabric of a blond woman&#x2019;s skirt. He has a slim gold wedding band on, and I wonder if the woman who gave it to him believed in love at first sight. </p><p>The train shoots underground and the faces around me look ashen in the yellow lights. I close my eyes for a moment, and everything, the lights, the people, the rapidly receding subway walls, slips away and I am rushing out into the bright sunshine. I walk up a long dune that leads to the beach, where I can hear the sound of the ocean. It sounds like a sigh. I open my eyes to see people looking back. </p><p>Has she fallen asleep? </p><p>I focus again on the pages in front of me. I tell myself, <i>All I want is to heal some heartbreak.</i> Upstairs in the glass-walled building, I flick on the desk lamp in my third-floor interior office. Without windows, the fluorescent lights give me a raucous headache, and I&#x2019;m not usually a headache kind of girl.

I examine it again, trying to break it down into pieces. I see a man who looks far older than his sixty years, walking down a winding set of stone stairs. At his feet, a small brown-and-white dog is captured mid-movement, and he has turned to face the camera above him, his eyes gazing back at mine.

Wrote a Swedish reporter, "lower than to the Five Points it is not possible for human nature to sink."<p> In his wide-ranging reconstruction of Five Points's few square blocks, historian Tyler Anbinder shows that that journalist was not far off the mark. "Dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of its residents lived in windowless, teeming apartments that were unfit for habitation," he writes. Alcoholism, violence, and prostitution were commonplace. Poverty was epidemic, and living conditions were so intolerable that the reforming sociologist Jacob Riis used the area as a case study for the wretched excesses of urban life. A corrupt city government kept the police at bay, making the neighborhood safe for a succession of crime lords but woefully dangerous for residents--most of whom, in time, would be newcomers from Ireland, Italy, Russia, and other faraway lands, as well as African Americans newly arrived from the South. "Locked into the lowest-paying occupations," as Anbinder writes, they labored, saved, and eventually moved on, making room for the next wave of immigrants.</p><p> Five Points is gone, though a few of its streets remain, marking the edge of Chinatown. Anbinder's careful study brings it back to life. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Tyler Anbinder</b> is an Associate Professor of History at George Washington University.

He hates history and loves bacon, rats, and playing tricks on his squeamish older sister.

Hungry demons and howling werewolves haunt his waking nightmares... and threaten his life.</p><p>Darren Shan is the author of the New York Times bestselling Cirque Du Freak series. He was born in London but at an early age he moved to Limerick, Ireland, with his parents and younger brother. He grew up watching old Dracula horror movies and reading spooky comics, which were the inspiration for his books. Darren is currently working on the second book in the Demonata series, Demon Thief, coming spring 2006.<br><br>Gr. 9-12. Older fans of Shan's gory, gripping Cirque du Freak series will welcome this first book in the Demonata series, which features a similar horrific spin, dark humor, and graphic detail. Grubitsch Grady ("Grubbs" for short) walks into his parents' bedroom to find his mother, father, and older sister torn to pieces by Lord Loss, a powerful demon that feeds on human pain and suffering. Grubbs is attacked by Lord Loss' familiars, marvelously creepy hybrid creatures, and to his great astonishment, he manages to escape. Not surprisingly, he ends up in a mental institution, completely derailed by the horror he has seen and experienced. Eventually, he is taken in by his uncle Dervish, discovers a cousin he never knew, and, alas, learns that lycanthropy runs in the family. The plot rolls along at high speed, but Shan is still quite adept when it comes to capturing Grubbs' roller-coaster emotions--loss and grief and, later, trust. A sneak peek at the second book in the series, <i>Demon Thief,</i> shows Shan continuing in the same vein but with different characters. <i>Debbie Carton</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

I didn&#x2019;t even have a cool pair of shades. All I had was a soundtrack curated by Tarantino playing in my head, one of those songs with horns and a fat bass track and a guitar going waka-ï¿½chaka-ï¿½waka-ï¿½chaka as I padded on asphalt with the uncomfortable feeling that someone was enjoying a voyeuristic close-ï¿½up of my feet.<br> &nbsp;<br> My plan wasn&#x2019;t masterful either. I was just going to wing it with an iron elemental named Ferris who was ready to do anything I asked, because he knew I&#x2019;d feed him magic for it down the road. A faery snack, perhaps, or an enchanted doodad of some kind. Ferris thought such things were sweet&#x2014;ï¿½magic might even give him something akin to a sugar rush. Before making my run, I contacted him through the earth in a park and filled him in on the plan. He&#x2019;d have to filter through the dead foundations of Toronto to follow me until it was time for him to act, but this was easier for him than it would be for most elementals. Lots of concrete got reinforced with iron rebar these days, and he&#x2019;s so strong at this point that he can afford to push through the lifeless underbelly of modern cities.<br> &nbsp;<br> I dropped off Oberon and my shoes in a shaded alley and cast camouflage on myself before emerging into the busy intersection of Front and York Streets in Toronto, where cameras from many sources might otherwise track me, not only the ones from the Royal Bank of Canada. But into the bank I strode at opening time, ducking in the doors behind someone else. Ferris followed underneath the street; I felt him buzzing through the sole of my bare right foot.<br> &nbsp;<br> Security dudes were present in the lobby but utterly unarmed. They were not there so much to stop people from committing a crime as to witness those crimes and provide polite but damning testimony later. The Canadians would rather track down and confront robbers when they were all alone than endanger citizens in a bank lobby. Some people might suggest you didn&#x2019;t need security if they were just going to stand there, but that&#x2019;s not the case. Cameras didn&#x2019;t catch everything. In memories they sometimes didn&#x2019;t work at all, because you were clever and had a snarky anarchist hacker in your crew with some kind of oral fixation on lollipops or whatever. But even if the cameras stayed on and recorded the whole crime, security guards would notice things the cameras might not&#x2014;ï¿½voices, eye color, details about clothing, and so on.<br> &nbsp;<br> Off to the right of the teller windows, the vault door remained closed. No one had asked to visit the safety deposit boxes yet. I&#x2019;d wait and sneak in with someone except that I could be waiting for far longer than my camouflage would hold out. And the clock was ticking on my target&#x2019;s usefulness; the sooner I got hold of it, the more damage I&#x2019;d be able to do. So I showed Ferris that vault door and asked him to take it apart. Let the alarms begin.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s magnificent, watching a vault door disintegrate and people lose their shit over it in real time. The soundtrack in my head kicked into high gear as I stepped over the melted slag to tackle the next obstacle: a locked glass door that showed me the safety deposit boxes beyond. It was bulletproof to small arms but lacked the thickness to stop heavy-ï¿½caliber rounds. Ferris couldn&#x2019;t help in taking apart the entire door like the vault, but that wasn&#x2019;t necessary; the locking mechanism was metal and he could melt that quickly, and he did. I pushed open the door and began searching for Box 517, the number I&#x2019;d been given. I found it on the left and near the floor. It was a wide, shallow, flat one, with one lock for the customer&#x2019;s key and one lock for the bank&#x2019;s. With another assist from Ferris, both locks were dispatched and I opened it, snatched out the slim three-ï¿½ring binder inside, and shoved it into my camouflaged pack before anyone even stepped inside the vault. I kicked the box closed just as a couple of guards finally appeared at the melted vault door, peeking through and seeing the open glass door. One of them was a doughy dude, tall and pillowy, and the other was a hard, cut Latino.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; the puffy one said. &#x201c;Anyone in there?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The fit guard assumed that someone was. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re on camera ï¿½wherever you go in here. You can&#x2019;t hide.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wrong.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why would he care about that?&#x201d; Doughboy said. &#x201c;Are you telling him to stop because he&#x2019;s being surveilled?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Hardbody scowled and hissed at his co-ï¿½worker, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to say something, don&#x2019;t I? What would you say?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If you surrender to us now,&#x201d; Doughboy called into the vault, &#x201c;we won&#x2019;t shoot you. Run away and they send the guys with guns.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a twat, Gary,&#x201d; Hardbody muttered.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gary&#x2014;ï¿½a much better name than Doughboy&#x2014;ï¿½blinked. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, what was that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I said you&#x2019;re right, Gary. That&#x2019;s what I should have said to the robber we can&#x2019;t see.&#x201d; Gary didn&#x2019;t look convinced that he&#x2019;d heard him incorrectly the first time, but the cut guard didn&#x2019;t give him time to pursue it. He stepped past the threshold of the vault and said, &#x201c;Maybe he&#x2019;s in the private room in the back.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I turned around to see what he was talking about and spotted another door in the rear of the vault. Normally when customers removed their safety deposit boxes, they would step into that private room and fondle their deposits in safety until they were ready to return it. Hardbody was heading for that door, and I pressed myself against the row of boxes to let him pass by. Gary followed only to the glass doorway. He stood there, blocking my exit, and frowned at the dissolved lock.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Somebody&#x2019;s got to be here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;This doesn&#x2019;t just happen by itself.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Hardbody tried the door to the private room and found it secure. He punched in a code on a mounted keypad and peered inside once it opened.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Anything there, Chuy?&#x201d; Gary asked, finally giving me a better name for him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nah.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, what the hell is going on? Is this guy a ninja or something?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Oberon would have loved to hear that, and I nearly made a noise that would have given me away had they the sense to turn off the alarm and listen. As it was, the electronic shriek gave me cover to sneak right up to Gary. Since I was fueling my camouflage on the limited battery of my bear charm, I couldn&#x2019;t stick around for much longer and wait for him to clear out of my way. Proper police would be around soon, and I didn&#x2019;t want to have to deal with them too.<br> &nbsp;<br> I reached out with both hands and shoved Gary hard through the threshold and to the left, leaving me a clear path to the vault door.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Chuy called you a twat, Gary,&#x201d; I said as I ran past. &#x201c;I heard him.&#x201d; It made me laugh, because Gary would have to report what Chuy called him since the perpetrator had said it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Much cursing and outrage followed in my wake from both of the guards. A manager type was just outside the vault on a cell phone, talking to police. &#x201c;Yes, sorry. There&#x2019;s something a bit odd going on here at the bank. Our door has been melted. Sorry.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The front doors to the bank had been automatically locked as part of the security protocols once the alarm went off, but Ferris gave me one more assist and I was out in the street. Whatever movement the cameras caught was fine; they would never get enough to identify me.<br> &nbsp;<br> I thanked Ferris for his help and asked him to remain in the area for his reward. I&#x2019;d have to scrounge up something suitably delicious for him before leaving.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>That was </i>fast, Oberon said through our mental link when I dropped my camouflage in the alley and chucked him under the chin. <br> <i>I didn&#x2019;t even get started on a nap</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Only way to do it. Every second at the scene increases chances of capture. Ready for a spot of breakfast?&#x201d; Oberon&#x2019;s last meal had been on the plains of Ethiopia, during the episode that revealed to me the existence of the binder I&#x2019;d just stolen. A tyromancer friend of mine named Mekera had pointed the way here after we&#x2019;d hunted up some rennet for her, but she didn&#x2019;t offer any snacks to us in the hours afterward.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Of course I&#x2019;m ready! When have I ever been unprepared to eat, Atticus?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Fair enough.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I knew that it&#x2019;s standard procedure to hole up in a nondescript warehouse or garage after robbing a bank, but I walked to Tim Hortons instead&#x2014;ï¿½affectionately known as Timmie&#x2019;s&#x2014;ï¿½because I felt like having something hot and coffee-ï¿½like and I didn&#x2019;t have a big bag of money in a burlap sack to mark me as a dastardly villain. Instead, I had a backpack and an Irish wolfhound on a leash, so I looked like a local student instead of the mysterious thief who slipped past the security of the Royal Bank of Canada in downtown Toronto.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Timmie&#x2019;s on York Street sported a garish green-ï¿½and-ï¿½yellow-ï¿½striped awning, a fire hydrant out front in case of donut grease fire, and a convenient signpost pointing the way to public parking. &#x201c;What kind of ungodly breakfast meat do you want from here?&#x201d; I asked Oberon as I tied him up to the sign.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The religion of the meat doesn&#x2019;t affect its taste, </i>my hound replied, a pedantic note creeping into his voice.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Godly bacon and ungodly bacon taste the same, Atticus.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Bacon it is. Now be nice to people who look scared of you while I&#x2019;m inside. Do not pee on the hydrant, and no barking.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Awww. I like to watch them jump. Sometimes they make squeaky noises.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I know, but we can&#x2019;t draw attention to ourselves right now.&#x201d; Sirens wailed in the glass and steel canyons of downtown as police converged on the bank. The cars would get there eventually, but the two bicycle cops I saw pedaling the wrong way down York Street would get there first. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back soon and we&#x2019;ll eat.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The teenager working the register judged me for ordering five bacon and egg sandwiches and a donut frosted in colors normally reserved for biohazard warnings. I could see it in her eyes: &#x201c;Nice looking for a ginger, but shame about the diet.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Well, as Oberon might say, I deserved a treat. Taking my maroon cup of coffee and a bag of greasy sandwiches outside, I sat next to my hound on the curb of York Street and unboxed breakfast for him as people emerged from the shop and wondered aloud what had the police in such an uproar.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Whadda yanno, Ed,&#x201d; a man said behind me. He hadn&#x2019;t been there when I entered, but a quick glance over my shoulder revealed him standing next to a friend in front of the window, both of them holding maroon cups like mine, both dressed in jeans and work boots and wearing light jackets. &#x201c;Sirens! That means crime. In Trahno.&#x201d; I smiled at the local tendency to reduce their three-ï¿½syllable city to two.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yep,&#x201d; Ed replied. I waited for more, but Ed seemed to have exhausted his thoughts on the subject.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Hey! </i>Oberon said, his tone accusatory as he gulped down the first sandwich. <i>This is bacon, Atticus!</i><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Didn&#x2019;t you say you wanted bacon?</i> I answered him mentally since I didn&#x2019;t want Ed or his friend to worry about my sanity if they saw me talking out loud to my hound.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>But I thought it would be Canadian bacon! Aren&#x2019;t we in Canada?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Yes, but maybe you were trying to be too clever there. People in Canada do not call that kind of meat Canadian bacon, the same way people in Belgium do not call their waffles Belgian waffles.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Well, it&#x2019;s still good. Thanks.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> I snarfed the donut and slurped up some coffee and then pulled out the cause of all the trouble: a binder full of names and addresses, many of them international. There was no handy title page announcing their significance, but they were alphabetized, and I flipped to the H&#x2019;s. There I found an entry for Leif Helgarson, providing his former location in Arizona. It told me two things: This was, as I&#x2019;d hoped, a directory of every vampire in the world, stored offline and therefore unhackable. But it was also months out of date at the very least. Leif had still nominally been the vampire lord of Arizona&#x2019;s sun-ï¿½kissed humans around the time of Granuaile&#x2019;s binding to the earth, but he&#x2019;d shown up twice in Europe since then&#x2014;ï¿½once in Greece and once in France. Germany too, if I counted a handwritten note. He was clearly on the move, and I had to assume the same would hold true for many other names on the list since I had started to pick off vampires via Fae mercenaries. Once word got out that this binder had been stolen, they would move for sure. So if it were to be of any use, I would have to move quickly, before they knew I had this. A USB drive with a file on it would have been more convenient, but since I was sure the idea was to make everything inconvenient for hackers and keep the speed of technology on their side, they had saved a hard copy only.<br> &nbsp;<br> The two who would hear about it first and perhaps spread the word were the safety deposit box&#x2019;s owners: the ancient vampire Theophilus and the arcane lifeleech, Werner Drasche. The latter was most likely in Ethiopia where I&#x2019;d left him, swearing in German and arranging a flight to Toronto. Theophilus, I knew, wouldn&#x2019;t be traveling across an ocean to chase me.</p><h2>The Backyard Blacksmith: Traditional Techniques for the Modern Smith (Backyard Series)</h2><p><i>The Backyard Blacksmith</i> takes the mystery out of blacksmithing, but not the magic...<p>There is an increasing interest and revival in the art of blacksmithing as a hobby and art, and both men and women are becoming at-home blacksmiths.

He is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of nine novels, including <i>The Ten Thousand, They Are Soldiers, God's Children,</i> and <i>More than Courage.</i> He lives in Fairfax, VA.</p><p><strong>Chapter One </strong></p><p><strong><strong>Alexandria, Virginia - September 3</strong></strong></p><p>The feeling of the sheets being pulled away from her, quickly followed by a sudden intake of breath from the other side of the bed, woke Christina Dixon with a start. Lifting her head from her pillow, she peered across at her husband, checking to see if he was awake yet. In the faint light that filtered in through the partially closed blinds, she watched as Nathan clutched the sheet to his chest in a death grip. His lips quivered as if he were speaking. It wouldn&#x2019;t be long before he was awake, Christina sadly concluded. It never was on a night like this. Taking great care, she laid her head back down on her pillow before rolling over on her side, facing away from Nathan. Through trial and error she&#x2019;d learned the hard way that the best thing she could do was to pretend that her husband&#x2019;s nocturnal stirrings didn&#x2019;t wake her. For some reason, knowing that his nightmares were depriving his wife of badly needed rest only added to Nathan&#x2019;s worries. He had enough on his mind, Christina reasoned. She didn&#x2019;t need to add to them. </p><p>With a suddenness that startled him, Nathan Dixon was catapulted from the dark, haunting place where his subconscious had taken him back into the dimly lit bedroom he shared with his pregnant wife. For the briefest of moments, he lay there staring wide eyed at the ceiling, gasping for breath like a drowning man as he struggled to compose himself. How strange, he found himself thinking after he&#x2019;d managed to regain some semblance of mental balance, to find the memories of a battle long since past more terrifying than the event itself. Try as he might, he couldn&#x2019;t remember experiencing anything even remotely resembling fear that night in the jungle. There&#x2019;d simply been too much to do, too much going on around him. Had there been confusion? Yes, of course. There always was in battle, particularly that one. Cutting through it and maintaining his focus on tactical concerns were the only things he recalled running through his mind as his company came to grips with Abu Sayyaf insurgents. The fear, like the haunting memories from which it sprang, only came later, long after he&#x2019;d been medevaced out of the Philippines. And rather than fading with the passage of time, his recollection of what happened that night only seemed to grow stronger, more intense, causing Nathan to wonder if his mind was hellbent on sorting out the blurred images that he hadn&#x2019;t had the time to pay attention to that night. </p><p>Having regained a modicum of self- control, Nathan looked over to see if his stirrings had woken his wife. Only when he was satisfied that she was still sound asleep did he carefully lift the covers off of himself, slip out of bed and quietly make his way to the guest bathroom just down the hall. Waiting until after he&#x2019;d closed the door, Nathan flipped on the light, turning to face the mirror as he did so. The first thought that popped into his head as he stared at his gaunt reflection was always the same on nights like this: was he going mad? Of course not, he quickly told himself&#x2014; perhaps too quickly. It&#x2019;s just the way things were, he reasoned. It was a new normal he hadn&#x2019;t quite yet managed to adjust to. Like the collection of wounds he&#x2019;d amassed along the way, the memories of past events were a natural and not at all surprising psychological byproduct stemming from his chosen profession. That his late father had never seemed troubled by his past didn&#x2019;t matter to Nathan. Scott Dixon had always come across as being one of those people who were bigger than life, a man who always gave the impression of being in complete control no matter how dire the situation. At least, that&#x2019;s the way Nathan and those who knew him chose to remember Scott. And despite his knack for coming across as a nonconformist in a profession where conformity was prized above all else, more than a few well- placed individuals who were privy to such things had pegged Scott Dixon as a shoe-in for the Chief of Staff of the Army. </p><p>Without realizing it, Nathan&#x2019;s concern over the recurring nightmares that plagued him was replaced by a deep, almost painful longing for his father. If there was anyone who would understand what he was going through, who could help him come to terms with his inability to put things in proper perspective, it was his father. Whether it stemmed from Scott Dixon&#x2019;s experience as a long- serving officer or was simply an inherent talent, he had a way of sweeping away all the peripheral fluff and chaff with ease, striking at the heart of the matter at hand with a deftness that inspired envy and confidence. </p><p>Planting his hands firmly upon the countertop, Nathan leaned forward, peering at his own reflection. If his father&#x2019;s incisiveness was an inherent trait, he thought to himself, it seemed to have skipped a generation. Even now, after devoting an inordinate amount of time pondering his future, Nathan had no idea what he would say when the question he knew was coming was put to him later that day. Glancing in the mirror at the clock on the wall behind him, he realized that he didn&#x2019;t have much time left to formulate a suitable answer, one that would address all the issues and concerns he found himself burdened with. </p><p>Sadly, the younger Dixon concluded that there was little point in returning to bed where he&#x2019;d do nothing more than toss and turn until he woke Chris. On mornings like this, it was better to head out into the predawn darkness and run. While doing so wouldn&#x2019;t help him reach any sort of decision, pushing his body to the limit would at least give his troubled mind a much- needed break. Besides, Nathan reasoned as he turned to gather his running shorts and T-shirt hanging on the back door of the bathroom, if he did decide to stay in the Army, he needed to get back in shape. Giving into the pain that lingered from his wounds was no longer an option, not if he was going to be the kind of soldier he&#x2019;d been raised to be. </p><p>The opening of the front door, followed by the sound of someone removing their shoes before venturing any farther, caused Jan Fields to stop what she&#x2019;d been doing. For the briefest of moments an irrational thought flashed through her mind, one that was as foolish as her efforts to convince herself that the visit by the former Chief of Staff of the Army with the obligatory chaplain in tow had never happened. These absurd little flights of fancy weren&#x2019;t helped any by the fact that her stepson&#x2019;s habits, even the noises he made as he climbed the stairs leading up to the main floor of her town house, were all but indistinguishable from those his father used to make whenever he returned from an early morning run. At times like this, Jan almost found herself having to stop what ever she was doing and mutter out loud, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not Scott. It is not Scott.&#x201d; </p><p>She barely had time to regain her composure before Nathan came plodding into the kitchen where she&#x2019;d been in the pro cess of slicing up a wedge of cantaloupe. Stealing a quick, fugitive glance over her shoulder, Jan took note of Nathan&#x2019;s limp before turning her attention back to what she was doing. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re up early,&#x201c; she stated crisply, doing her best to sound cheery despite the pain she felt over her son&#x2019;s suffering. </p><p>Before answering, Nathan reached around her, quickly snatching a chunk of cantaloupe from the cutting board. He wasn&#x2019;t fast enough, however, to escape a quick slap on the back of his hand from Jan, who used the flat of her knife to punish his impatience. &#x201c;Wait till I&#x2019;m done.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; he countered before popping his pilfered prize in his mouth. </p><p>&#x201c;Because you haven&#x2019;t washed your hands, that&#x2019;s why.&#x201d; She was about to add &#x201c;young man&#x201d; to her response as she&#x2019;d done so many times over the years, but didn&#x2019;t. Somehow it just didn&#x2019;t seem appropriate to refer to a captain in the Army, whose name had just come out on the latest promotion list, in that manner. </p><p>For his part Nathan found it all but impossible to suppress a chuckle as he made his way over to the sink. &#x201c;And what&#x2019;s so funny?&#x201d; Jan asked incredulously. </p><p>Knowing better than telling her what was really on his mind, he opted for a response that was in keeping with his determination to keep things as lighthearted and easygoing as possible while he and Chris were living with Jan. &#x201c;Geez, Mom,&#x201c; he mockingly whimpered. #34;You&#x2019;re acting like I was a five- year- old.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Well, when you act like you&#x2019;re five...&#x201d; </p><p>Her words were cut short by the sight of a hand reaching around from behind her in an effort to snatch another chunk of cantaloupe. This time she managed to slap her son&#x2019;s hand with the flat of her knife before he managed to secure a piece of fruit from her cutting board. </p><p>&#x201c;Ouch! That hurts.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Good,&#x201c; Jan replied in triumph. &#x201c;Now, be a good boy and sit down and give me a chance to finish.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Gee,&#x201c; Nathan muttered, shuffling over to the breakfast bar where he took a seat, making a great show of rubbing the back of his hand as he did so. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the respect?&#x201d; </p><p>Rather than respond, Jan smiled to herself as she turned her attention back to finishing with the cantaloupe. It was moments like this that vindicated her decision to insist that Nathan and his wife stay with her while awaiting new orders after he&#x2019;d been discharged from the hospital. Whatever inconvenience and disruption they caused in her life were more than offset by the opportunity they afforded her to once more be part of a family. And though she knew that Nathan and Chris would soon be moving on, just as she and Scott had done with a regularity that was often annoying but always exciting, Jan was determined to make the most of...</p></p><h2>An Introduction to the Keys of Enoch</h2><p>This book contains twelve of the 64 Keys in The Book of Knowledge: The Keys of Enoch.

Until relatively recently, Jacques Derrida was seen by many as nothing more than the high priest of Deconstruction, by turns stimulating and fascinating, yet always somewhat disengaged from the central political questions of our time. Or so it seemed. Derrida&#x2019;s &#x201c;political turn,&#x201d; marked especially by the appearance of Specters of Marx, has surprised some and delighted others. In The Politics of Friendship Derrida renews and enriches this orientation through an examination of the political history of the idea of friendship pursued down the ages. Derrida&#x2019;s thoughts are haunted throughout the book by the strange and provocative address attributed to Aristotle, &#x201c;my friends, there is no friend&#x201d; and its inversions by later philosophers such as Montaigne, Kant, Nietzsche, Schmitt and Blanchot. The exploration allows Derrida to recall and restage the ways in which all the oppositional couples of Western philosophy and political thought&#x2014;friendship and enmity, private and public life&#x2014;have become madly and dangerously unstable. At the same time he dissects genealogy itself, the familiar and male-centered notion of fraternity and the virile virtue whose authority has gone unquestioned in our culture of friendship and our models of democracy The future of the political, for Derrida, becomes the future of friends, the invention of a radically new friendship, of a deeper and more inclusive democracy. This remarkable book, his most profoundly important for many years, offers a challenging and inspiring vision of that future.</p><p>Jacques Derrida is Director of Studies at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris, and holds a visiting appointment at the University of California, Irvine. Recent English translations of his work include Given Time, Memories of the Blind, Specters of Marx and The Gift of Death.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Grand Central Winter: Stories from the Street</h2><p><b>A <i>New York Times </i>Notable Book</b><br><br>Whether Lee Stringer is describing "God's corner" as he calls 42nd Street, or his friend Suzy, a hooker and "past due tourist" whose infant child he sometimes babysits, whether he is recounting his experiences at Street News, where he began hawking the newspaper for a living wage, then wrote articles, and served for a time as muckraking senior editor, whether it is his adventures in New York's infamous Tombs jail, or performing community service, or sleeping in the tunnels below Grand Central Station by night and collecting cans by day, this is a book rich with small acts of kindness, humor and even heroism alongside the expected violence and desperation of life on the street. There is always room, Stringer writes, "amid the costume" jewel glitter...for one more diamond in the rough."<br>Two events rise over Grand Central Winter like sentinels: Stringer's discovery of crack cocaine and his catching the writing bug. Between these two very different yet oddly similar activities, Lee's life unwound itself, during the 1980s, and took the shape of an odyssey, an epic struggle to find meaning and happiness in arid times. He eventually beat the first addiction with help from a treatment program. The second addiction, writing, has hold of him still.<br>Among the many accomplishments of this book is that Stringer is able to convey something of the vitality and complexity of a down&#x2014;and&#x2014;out life. The reader walks away from it humming its melody, one that is more wise than despairing, less about the shame we feel when confronted with a picture of those less fortunate, and more about the joy we feel when we experience our shared humanity.</p><p>Curled deep in his burrow in a Grand Central Station crawlspace, Lee Stringer--ragged, homeless, addicted to crack--is digging around for something he can use to clean his crack pipe. Finally his fingers latch around "some sort of smooth straight stick": a pencil. In the days that follow, he carries it with him wherever he goes. "So I have this pencil with me all the time and then one day I'm sitting there in my hole with nothing to smoke and nothing to do and I pull the pencil out just to look at the film of residue stuck to the sides--you do that sort of thing when you don't have any shit--and it dawns on me that it's a pencil. I mean it's got a lead in it and all, and you can write with the thing." And so that's what he does. "Pretty soon I forget all about hustling and getting a hit. I'm scribbling like a maniac; heart pumping, adrenaline rushing, hands trembling. I'm so excited I almost crap on myself. It's just like taking a hit." <p> <i>Grand Central Winter</i> is the tale of Stringer's twin addictions--writing and crack--and the lengths he went to in order to satisfy each. But Stringer dwells on neither his descent into hell nor the long journey back. Instead, he paints a nuanced portrait of street life itself, its pleasures as well as its terrors. Hustlers, hookers, dealers, and addicts come to life in a series of vignettes that are tough, unsentimental, but compassionate to the core. There's honest rage to be found in <i>Grand Central Winter</i>, but precious little political posturing. "Policy is never the real issue," he writes in "Dear Homey," his advice column for New York's homeless paper, <i>Street News</i>. "The real issue is the hearts of men."</p>Whether Lee Stringer is describing &#34;God&#39;s corner&#34; as he calls 42nd Street, or his friend Suzy, a hooker and &#34;past-due tourist&#34; whose infant child he sometimes babysits, whether he is recounting his experiences at Street News, where he began hawking the newspaper for a living wage, then wrote articles, and served for a time as muckraking senior editor, whether it is his adventures in New York&#39;s infamous Tombs jail, or performing community service, or sleeping in the tunnels below Grand Central Station by night and collecting cans by day, this is a book rich with small acts of kindness, humor and even heroism alongside the expected violence and desperation of life on the street.

The best tips for better times and improved safety.</p><p>Keith started riding in the dark ages of motorcycling, the 1950&#39;s. He first raced in the 60&#39;s at age 16, again in the 70&#39;s, 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s. He went to design school; was a photographer; designed and manufactured shoes for the stars; sold pretzels on the street; was a full on drug addict in the 60&#39;s; cleaned up with Dianetics; became a writer, inventor and dedicated himself to understanding and teaching the art of riding motorcycles. He was the first person to put words to roadracing and riding, and his research continues today. Keith lives in Glendale, California with his soul mate of 40 years, Judy. He has one son, Dylan.Simply the best sport riding book available! As a riding coach/instructor I see allot of new riders. One of the first things I do is recommend this book. Those that read it perform signifigantly better than those that don't. While some may not understand the physics of riding, this book does a phenominal job of explaining it in a manner most can comprehend. Geared towards the track many might think it;s not for them. Track or street the physics are all the same. Simply put, this book WILL make you a better, safer rider!! --Mark 2474 Barnes and Noble March 2010<br><br>Need to Know Info If You Ride Bought my first street bike, a CBR929RR but couldn't get into a riding course early enough so I bought this book to get a head start. It 'over prepared' me for the riding course I took and when the intructor congratulated me for my perfect score I mentioned 'Twist of The Wrist'. The Instructors were not surprised as they were very familiar w/ the book. --Anonymous Barnes and Noble April 2001<br><br>This review is from: A Twist of the Wrist 2: The Basics of High-Performance Motorcycle Riding (Paperback) This book will teach you how to ride like Doohan instead of riding like a squid (eg fast and smooth instead of point and shoot). "A twist of the wrist 2" will teach you how to ride faster, smoother, safer, it could save your life and will teach you more about motorcycle riding technique than you thought you could ever know. This guy (Keith Code) taught Doug Chandler how to go faster. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. This volume teaches you cornering technique that applies to any situation. The main chapter headings are "throttle control", "rider input", "steering", "vision", "braking", "traction" and "racing". You will learn that smoothness equals speed and safety. Using the techniques taught by Keith you will find even a bike like my Yamaha Virago 1100 is a pretty quick bike through corners as long as you set up a smooth entry into the corner, then power through and blast o! ut the other side. I've blown away squids on GSXR750s and 1100s using this riding style, mainly because I can now carry a higher cornering speed. Keith teaches you that braking hard into a corner just upsets the suspension and maked the bike pogo all th way through. Get your braking done before the corner and the suspension is set up to provide traction all the way through the corner. --By Peter Tosi (cdog@cairns.net.au)</p><h2>Jewish People, Jewish Thought: The Jewish Experience in History</h2><p>One volume work that discussed the historical and political history in the context of religion and culture.

Indeed, Dickens drew strongly on his own experiences as the source for much of his fiction. Here the author offers a fresh view of Dickens&#39;s remarkable life story. Dickens&#39;s novels brim with references: they are located in the places he lived in and visited, peopled with characters he knew, and inspired by the preoccupations that haunted his mind. Ackroyd highlights the reality of Victorian life, warts and all, and the issues that sparked Dickens&#39;s fervent calls for social reform; and he also charts the influential landmarks of that era, such as the coming of the railways, the effects upon society of the industrial revolution and the expansion of the British Empire. Dickens was a complex personality. He apparently had everything - fame, success, wealth - but he died harbouring the great sadness he had carried with him all his life, and he was humble enough to forbid a grand funeral. Like many eminent Victorians, he led a double life. Although he insisted that nothing in the newspapers he edited should offend his middle-class readers, he regularly indulged in dubious night-time escapades with fellow-author Wilkie Collins and, for the final 13 years of his life, kept a secret mistress, Ellen Ternan.</p><p>"Dickens saw reality as a reflection of his own fiction," contends Ackroyd, novelist and biographer of T.S. Eliot ( T.S. Eliot: A Life , LJ 11/15/84) and Ezra Pound ( Ezra Pound , Thames &amp; Hudson, 1987). This massive life and times attempts to re-create Dickens's internal and external realities. Ackroyd makes better use of the autobiographical memoranda first published in John Forster's Life (1872-74) than did Edgar Johnson in his Charles Dickens (S. &amp; S., 1952), and the interweaving of critical comments with his presentation of Dickens's personal and social preoccupations often yields more insights than does Johnson's technique of interlarded essays. The same vast mental and physical energies that led Dickens to triumph drove him to an obsessive need for total control of all aspects of his personal and professional life. Furthermore, his sensibility was formed in a pre-Victorian England that was often squalid and brutal, and which frequently relied on role-playing as a guide to conduct. Ackroyd's great strength is his ability to draw the reader into a sensory apprehension of this world. A lack of footnotes will keep scholars turning to Johnson and Fred Kaplan's shorter and far less evocative Dickens: A Life ( LJ 9/1/88), but this engrossing work is enthusiastically recommended for academic and large public libraries.<br><i>- Barbara J. Dunlap, City Coll., CUNY</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ackroyd ( The Last Testament of Oscar Wilde ) is a master biographer with a seductive prose style, and this massive volume is likely to stand as the Dickens biography for decades to come. Ackroyd moves around with authority in the world of the ebullient, ambitious, insecure, haunted, theatrical genius, which is also the world of early and mid-Victorian England assimilated and transformed to a stupefying degree. We read about Dickens's penurious and painful childhood; the triumphant reception of his first novel, The Pickwick Papers ; the prodigious flow of subsequent novels which, though increasingly somber in tone, continued to reflect a mind whose primary reaction to experience was anarchic laughter; the two trips to America, for the most part wildly successful; the scandal surrounding Dickens's desertion of his wife. And Ackroyd pinpoints Dickens's two great innovations: he was the first to introduce the language of the romantic poets into the novel; and his dramatic public readings from his novels constituted a new art form.

The fast-paced swashbuckling will surely satisfy fans of adventure, but it's really Egg's narration that makes this pirate story rise above its counterparts. Wittily observant and self-deprecating, Egg relays the series of absurd events that precede his escape from Deadweather with a fair amount of humor, while his decision to avenge the deaths of his family&#x2014;despite their mistreatment of him&#x2014;lends the tale a certain nobility.&#x201d;<br>FROM&nbsp;<i>THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE</i>:<br>&#x201c;What a wonderful hybrid plot: islands, buried treasure, a lad avenging violence against his family, sea voyages, tourist cruises, real pirates, fake pirates for the tourist trade, and leftover pirates, too maimed for sea work. . . .

I also enjoyed the added variety of options and ideas she gave with each design, for example, her pendant that could be re-sized for earrings or multiplied for a bracelet.&nbsp;In the introductory section on stitches she included valuable information on how to combine or switch between types of stitches.&nbsp;This is something that is not even mentioned in beginning beading books.&nbsp;Her Basic Beading Kit will be a starting point for all my future projects. Her ornate closures were in keeping with each piece she designed, adding to the historic feel.&nbsp;I tried the St. Petersburg chain and found her instructions well written and the graphics easy to follow. Just looking through the book and seeing the objects she was able to interpret in beads and the gallery of even more elaborate pieces inspired me.&#x201d; - <b>Linda Feinberg, Chicago Metal Arts Guild blog</b>, March 2012</p></p><h2>Scum of the Earth</h2><p>A new edition of Arthur Koestler&#39;s gripping tale of arrest, imprisonment, and subsequent escape to London from Nazi-occupied France.</p><p></p><h2>The Stars My Destination</h2><p>Such is the official verdict on Gully Foyle, unskilled space crewman.

The story of its final, brutal collapse in the autumn of 2008, and its controversial sale to JPMorgan Chase, is an astonishing account of how one bank lost itself to greed and mismanagement, and how the entire financial industry&#x2014;and even the entire country&#x2014; lost its way as well. <br><br>Kirsten Grind&#x2019;s <i>The Lost Bank </i>is a magisterial and gripping account of these events, tracing the cultural shifts, the cockamamie financial engineering, and the hubris and avarice that made this incredible story possible. The men and women who become the central players in this tragedy&#x2014; the regulators and the bankers, the home buyers and the lenders, the number crunchers and the shareholders&#x2014;are heroes and villains, perpetrators and victims, often switching roles with one another as the drama unfolds. <br><br>As a reporter at the time for the <i>Puget Sound Business Journal, </i>Grind covered a story set far from the epicenters of finance and media. It happened largely in places such as the suburban homes of central California and the office buildings of Seattle, but Grind covered the story from the beginning, and the clarity and persistence of her reporting earned her many awards, including being named a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the Gerald Loeb Award. She takes readers into boardrooms and bedrooms, revealing the power struggles that pitted regulators at the Office of Thrift Supervision and the FDIC against one another and the predatory negotiations of investment bankers and lawyers who enriched themselves during the bank&#x2019;s rise and then devoured the decimated bank in its final days. <br><br>Written as compellingly as the finest fiction, <i>The Lost Bank </i>makes it clear that the collapse of Washington Mutual was not just the largest bank failure in American history. It is a story of talismanic qualities, reflecting the incredible rise and the precipitous collapse of not only an institution but of trust, fortunes, and the marketplaces for risk across the world.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, June 2012</strong>: The collapse of Washington Mutual in September 2008 was the largest bank failure in U.S. history and a symbolic casualty of America&#x2019;s unfolding financial crisis. <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter Kristen Grind provides a fascinating fly-on-the-boardroom-wall account of the bank&#x2019;s final hours, and takes us back through the history of what started as a quirky, familial savings and loan and became a byword for America&#x2019;s financial malfunction. This is no tedious, dry retelling of a story we&#x2019;ve heard hundreds of times in the last four years&#x2014;Grind masterfully explains even the most complex financial concepts and has a natural talent for ferreting out tiny but humanizing details.

In it Bataille examines death&#x2014;the "little death" that follows sexual climax, the proximate death in sadomasochistic practices, and death as part of religious ritual and sacrifice.</p><p>"Bataille is one of the most important writers of the century."&#x2014; Michel Foucault</p><p>Georges Bataille was born in Billom, France, in 1897.

Yet neither Jim nor his mother nor his three uncles--who have split the paternal role neatly among themselves since the death of Jim's father a decade earlier--are feeling much in the way of economic pain. Indeed, if you stuck a satellite dish on the front lawn, the story might be taking place in the New South rather than the older, bucolic one.<p> This isn't to suggest that Earley is deaf to social detail. Indeed, there are all sorts of wonderful touches, like the dï¿½cor in Jim's classroom, with its "large, colorful maps of the United States, the Confederacy, and the Holy Land during the time of Jesus." But <i>Jim the Boy</i> is very much the tale of a 10-year-old's expanding consciousness, which at first barely extends beyond the family property. Earley has a real gift for conveying childhood epiphanies, like Jim's sudden apprehension of the wider world during a trip in Uncle Al's truck: </p><blockquote> Two thoughts came to Jim at once, joined by a thread of amazement: he thought, <i>People live here</i>, and he thought, <i>They don't know who I am</i>. At that moment the world opened up around Jim like hands that, until that moment, had been cupped around him; he felt very small, almost invisible, in the open air of their center, but knew that the hands would not let him go. It was almost like flying. </blockquote> The simple lyricism and anti-ironic sweetness work mostly to the book's advantage. There are times, it's true, when Earley sands his prose down to an unnatural smoothness, and we seem to be edging toward the sentimental precincts of a young-adult novel. But on the whole, <i>Jim the Boy</i> is a lovely, meticulous work--a song of innocence and (eventually) experience, delivered with just a hint of a North Carolina accent. <i>--James Marcus</i>Tony Earley&#39;s short stories earned him a place on Granta&#39;s list of the 20 Best Young American Fiction Writers in 1996 and a National Magazine Award for fiction.

She made her crime fiction debut in 2005 with LAST RITUALS, the first instalment in the Thora Gudmundsdottir series, and has been translated into more than 30 languages. Her work stands &#39;comparison with the finest contemporary crime writing anywhere in the world&#39; according to the Times Literary Supplement. The second instalment in the Thora Gudmundsdottir series, MY SOUL TO TAKE, was shortlisted for the 2010 Shamus Award. In 2011 her stand-alone horror novel I REMEMBER YOU was awarded the Icelandic Crime Fiction Award and was nominated for The Glass Key. Her novel THE SILENCE OF THE SEA won the Petrona Award in 2015.Chapter 1 <br>&nbsp; <br>March 18, 2008 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Thï¿½ra Gudmundsdï¿½ttir put down the overview of her last month&#x2019;s work schedule at the legal firm. It was hardly what she would call encouraging reading: The cases taken by her and Bragi, her business partner, along with two paralegals, were numerous, but mostly small-scale and quickly processed. That was certainly good for the firm&#x2019;s clients, but it didn&#x2019;t put much in the till. Nor was it all about the money. The most exciting cases demanded a great deal of work and were more complex than the smaller ones, which were usually run-of-the-mill and monotonous. Thï¿½ra groaned inwardly. She didn&#x2019;t dare groan audibly for fear that one of the young lawyers would hear her. If he sensed that she were worried about the firm&#x2019;s workload, he might start thinking of moving on, and they could not afford that. She and Bragi could never run the firm and everything belonging to it&#x2014;not least their dreadful secretary, Bella&#x2014;alone. Although it would be difficult to imagine how it could be possible to do her job any worse than Bella herself did it, Thï¿½ra had no interest in stepping in for the girl, and Bragi would do whatever was necessary to avoid having to sit and take phone calls. So they would just have to accept this arrangement: these two young lawyers who appeared more interested in YouTube than Supreme Court judgments, and Bella, who also spent more time than was healthy on the Internet. <br>Thï¿½ra turned back to the list of clients and cases. Divorces, bankruptcies, and other financial entanglements were the most prominent types of case by far. There were some involving inheritances, paternity suits, and sporadic minor cases. It was probably not appropriate to think so, but Thï¿½ra longed for more criminal cases. They were much more demanding than divorces, which Bragi had been specializing in recently. He had built up a good reputation in this area, which meant that more and more people turned to the firm for help when their marriages were on the rocks. <br>Such cases, however, could often be quite colorful. One of her current clients was a man named Trausti, who wanted to change his name following his divorce since his wife had left him for another man with the same name. Of course it was no trouble to obtain permission to name oneself something other than what was recorded on the church register. But things became complicated when this was not enough for Trausti; he also insisted that their children&#x2019;s patronymics be changed accordingly. He wanted to make it clear to everyone that he and not his wife&#x2019;s new partner was the father of his children. Although the laws on namegiving allowed for changes in children&#x2019;s surnames under special circumstances, the legislation had not foreseen this possibility, thus there was no easy resolution to the case. Thï¿½ra thought it highly unlikely that a Trausti who did not want to be named Trausti would be permitted to change his children&#x2019;s surname, especially in light of the children&#x2019;s mother being totally opposed to the change. Her protestations only made her husband more determined to have his way, and in the end Thï¿½ra gave in and sent a letter describing the matter to the Minister of Justice. By then Thï¿½ra would actually have been completely willing to change her <i>own</i> name rather than sign such an unprecedented letter. Over a month had passed since she had sent it, and still no word had been received. She took that to mean that the authorities were wondering if this were some sort of joke. <br>At the time, her own divorce had certainly brought out less than the best in her and Hannes, her ex-husband. However, they hadn&#x2019;t had the imagination for anything much beyond quarreling over worldly possessions&#x2014;which of them would get the flat-screen TV, and so on. Name changes would have been inconceivable. It was probably this experience that distinguished her from Bragi, who enjoyed working on such cases. He had been happily married to the same woman for three decades, and thus had no personal experience of marital failure. Thï¿½ra, on the other hand, could easily identify with her clients and what they were going through. As a result, what she always wanted most was to tell her clients to face the fact that lying ahead of them were difficult times in which the spouse who was previously so dear to them would radically transform into the Devil himself and that no one, not even their mothers, would feel like listening to the dramatic stories of the other&#x2019;s cruelty. Enough time had passed since Thï¿½ra&#x2019;s own divorce for her to realize how unbearable she must have been; she had taken every opportunity she could in her conversations with others to complain about how impossible Hannes was. She had clearly been extremely unreasonable toward him&#x2014;and vice versa. In any case, divorce had been the only sensible option in their situation, since they both agreed that they&#x2019;d had enough. <br>Now things looked different. Thï¿½ra was in a stable relationship with Matthew Reich, who had accepted a job as head of security for Kaupthing Bank. But they hadn&#x2019;t yet gone so far as to move in together. Not for lack of willingness on his part&#x2014;it was Thï¿½ra who wasn&#x2019;t quite ready. She was in over her head at the moment: Her two children, Sï¿½ley and Gylfi, made sure her hands were always full, not to mention her grandson Orri, who was almost two. Thï¿½ra was much more involved in Orri&#x2019;s life than most grandmothers; her son had only been a child himself when he and his girlfriend, Sigga, had rushed rather heedlessly into their biological experiment. As a result, they would never be named Parents of the Year; with their son they behaved almost more like his siblings, and didn&#x2019;t fully shoulder the responsibilities that come with a small child. Thï¿½ra realized this was partly her own fault, along with Sigga&#x2019;s parents&#x2019;. It was too easy to take over and do things herself; easier than following from a distance the teenagers&#x2019; unorthodox attempts at childcare. When Orri was with her, it was as if the child were Thï¿½ra&#x2019;s own. She felt happiest when the boy was at home, but when she took him and his young parents into town she must have looked like a dubious mother, to put it mildly. Orri was barely talking and he already called Thï¿½ra &#x201c;mama,&#x201d; meaning that those who didn&#x2019;t know their situation must have thought she was a bit strange, letting her older children look after the youngest and not seeming to care when Orri cried or called for his mother. But that was the life of a young grandmother. <br>So it wasn&#x2019;t because she didn&#x2019;t want to live with Matthew that she had responded to his suggestion unenthusiastically. She just found it so comforting to be able to switch to a different life now and then; a life in which everything was clean and tidy; no dirty diapers, no sandwiches to make or piles of clothes to wash. In that other life Thï¿½ra could go out to eat at a cafï¿½, or do whatever else she wanted. That life revolved only around her and Matthew, adults with no obligation to wake up at the crack of dawn on weekends and watch cartoons. Thï¿½ra enjoyed that parallel life only on alternate weekends, when the whole gang abandoned her home and went to Hannes and his new wife. Few things cheered Thï¿½ra more than the pretend look of happiness on Weekend Daddy&#x2019;s face when she drove up to his house with the youngsters. His smile had grown even stiffer after Sigga fell out with her mother and moved in with Thï¿½ra. She reluctantly went along with the others to Hannes&#x2019;s and as soon as he tried to object, Gylfi said simply that if Sigga were made to feel unwelcome in any way he wouldn&#x2019;t come either. His father quickly held his tongue and never complained again about the lack of space. Gylfi was now eighteen years old, which meant that he wasn&#x2019;t obliged to spend time with his father every other weekend; in fact he could have refused to do so from the age of sixteen. Thï¿½ra doubted Gylfi realized this, but she had decided not to mention it so that he and his father would remain in touch. And also so that she herself would continue to have some space. <br>Thï¿½ra tried to direct her attention back to her work&#x2014;a draft of a prenuptial agreement. Part of it concerned a two-story single-family home which was to be divided into two separate apartments to save the owner (the prospective bridegroom) from the black hole of the currency basket loan that he had taken at the wrong time, during a fit of great optimism. <br>Before she could get back to work, Matthew called. It was rather unusual for him to call her during working hours&#x2014;unlike Thï¿½ra, he was quite formal and took everything very seriously. For example, he had enrolled in a course in Icelandic for foreigners&#x2014;he was German&#x2014;and worked on it very diligently. At first she had helped him out with the homework and had been unable to resist the temptation to slip in a few words at an inappropriately high level. Matthew wasn&#x2019;t at all amused when this came to light, and he stopped asking for her help. Thï¿½ra&#x2019;s daughter Sï¿½ley had then taken over as teacher&#x2019;s aide. She was only eight years old and thus still had an almost unlimited respect for every sort of schooling. As a result the two of them had become good friends and Matthew started making quick progress in the language, even though he and Thï¿½ra still spoke German together. <br>&#x201c;How would you like to take on a little project for the bank?&#x201d; asked Matthew, after apologizing for calling her at work. <br>&#x201c;The bank?&#x201d; repeated Thï¿½ra. She was surprised, since the banks had armies of specialists and lawyers at their fingertips. &#x201c;What kind of project?&#x201d; She stared at the prenup awaiting her on the computer screen. Did they need a contract of this sort? Had their own army of lawyers refused to come anywhere near such trivialities? <br>&#x201c;It has to do with a performance bond,&#x201d; replied Matthew. &#x201c;The bank has guaranteed a contractor called Berg Technology, which apparently is not going to fulfill a contract it signed with a British mining company. It looks as if the British want to claim insurance, meaning the bank will take the hit. It really is a lot of money, even more in the current financial situation, since the guarantee is in euros.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And what&#x2019;s my job?&#x201d; asked Thï¿½ra. &#x201c;Get the mining company to drop their claim to the money?&#x201d; <br>Matthew laughed curtly. &#x201c;No, neither you nor anyone else would be able to do that. I understand they&#x2019;re really hard to deal with, since they&#x2019;re not in the business of giving money away. Even if they get the insurance money out of the bank, they still lose out on the work contract. They&#x2019;re simply cutting their losses.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What am I supposed to do?&#x201d; asked Thï¿½ra. &#x201c;See to it that the euros change hands, or maybe try to file a complaint?&#x201d; This was sounding potentially even duller than prenups, so it might be better not to take the job. <br>&#x201c;Neither,&#x201d; replied Matthew. &#x201c;As things have gone, Berg Technology is way behind schedule and unlikely to be able to make up for the delays that have already occurred. On top of that, their work has come to a complete stop, and it looks as if that situation won&#x2019;t be remedied any time soon. Their employees refuse to return to the site, and the work is so specialized that replacements can&#x2019;t be picked up off the street. The plan is to send a team there to assess things and decide whether the bank should hire another contractor if the situation is irretrievable.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Can they do that?&#x201d; she asked. Although her work had focused on contract law for some time now, an actual construction contract had never found its way onto her desk. She was not that familiar with them, but knew enough to understand what they involved, and to realize that they were considerably different from other, more traditional contracts. <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Matthew. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to send you the construction contract and the details of the performance bond if you&#x2019;re interested, but I hope you understand that I can&#x2019;t do so unless you&#x2019;ve accepted the project.&#x201d; <br>Thï¿½ra thought it over for a moment. &#x201c;Am I to understand that the work is being done overseas?&#x201d; She was quite prepared to get out of Iceland for a few days. The winter had been the hardest she could remember for a while, and although it was March it was still one storm after another. <br>&#x201c;Yes, you would have to go abroad,&#x201d; he said, without elaborating. <br>The tone of his voice suggested someplace rather unexciting. She was fairly sure there were no Icelandic contractors working in Gaza, Iraq, Afghanistan or any other war zone, so it couldn&#x2019;t be too bad. &#x201c;What type of work is this precisely, and where?&#x201d; she asked, crossing her fingers in the hope that it involved building a hotel in the Caribbean. She had a great bikini that she hadn&#x2019;t had the chance to saunter around in since God knows when, and it was conceivable that the mining company wanted to branch out and try its luck in the tourist industry. <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re doing preliminary studies and constructing infrastructure facilities on behalf of Arctic Mining for a mining operation in Greenland. Berg Technology made the lowest bid for the project and has had workers there for nearly a year. Until now everything has gone without a hitch, though the results haven&#x2019;t been exemplary. But now something has happened to unsettle the workers.&#x201d; <br>Thï¿½ra&#x2019;s mind had begun to wander when she heard the name. Greenland. One of the few countries that was colder and more unbearable at this time of year than Iceland. Her bikini would be of no use if she took this job&#x2014;what she&#x2019;d need would be sealskin trousers. She swallowed her disappointment. &#x201c;Are the workers in Greenland?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, they&#x2019;re in Iceland. All but two people who are probably still on-site. The others came home during their allotted leave, but now refuse to return.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What do you mean when you say that the two who remained behind are <i>probably</i> still on-site?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nothing&#x2019;s been heard from them for around ten days, and they can&#x2019;t get hold of anyone there to go and find out what&#x2019;s happening. It&#x2019;s possible that the camp&#x2019;s communication system has simply failed, but apparently the only way to find out is to go there. If a logical explanation is found for their silence, it&#x2019;s conceivable that the other employees can be persuaded to return. That of course would be the best solution for the bank.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Could something have happened to them? Could they have been trapped outside, or something along those lines?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s one possible explanation,&#x201d; said Matthew. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s happened before. About six months ago a geologist there disappeared from the camp, a young woman, now presumed dead. She was never found, but it&#x2019;s most likely that she got lost in a storm and froze to death.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;She was out taking a walk in a <i>snowstorm</i>?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nobody knows,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;She disappeared, so she could have committed suicide. People tend to get depressed in that kind of isolation.&#x201d; Thï¿½ra was silent, not knowing how to respond. Matthew was quick to add, &#x201c;That incident has nothing to do with your task, nor with the disappearance of the two others. In the best-case scenario, they&#x2019;re still alive; the camp&#x2019;s transmitter has failed and they simply haven&#x2019;t been able to get it working again. Other explanations for their fate are rather more gloomy: The weather there has been like it&#x2019;s been here recently, only worse. They wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to survive it if they were anywhere but indoors. In any case, things have become serious, both with regard to these men and to the interests of Berg Technology&#x2014;and, by association, the bank.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it simpler to call on a Greenlandic emergency rescue team, or the police there?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;This a...</p><h2>Tepper Isn&#39;t Going Out: A Novel</h2><p>Murray Tepper would say that he is an ordinary New Yorker who is simply trying to read the newspaper in peace. But he reads while sitting behind the wheel of his parked car, and his car always seems to be in a particularly desirable parking spot. Not surprisingly, he is regularly interrupted by drivers who want to know if he is going out.<br><br>Tepper isn&#x2019;t going out. Why not? His explanations tend to be rather literal: the indisputable fact, for instance, that he has twenty minutes left on the meter. <br><br>Tepper&#x2019;s behavior sometimes irritates the people who want his spot. (&#x201c;Is that where you live? Is that car rent-controlled?&#x201d;) It also irritates the mayor&#x2014;Frank Ducavelli, known in tabloid headlines as Il Duce&#x2014;who sees Murray Tepper as a harbinger of what His Honor always calls &#x201c;the forces of disorder.&#x201d;<br><br>But once New Yorkers become aware of Tepper, some of them begin to suspect that he knows something they don&#x2019;t know. And an ever-increasing number of them are willing to line up for the opportunity to sit in his car with him and find out.<br><br>Tepper Isn&#x2019;t Going Out is a wise and witty story of an ordinary man who, perhaps innocently, changes the world around him.</p><p>New York City and America's car culture smash together in Calvin Trillin's <i>Tepper Isn't Going Out</i>, a humorous tale of the urban quest for an open parking space. When a mailing-list broker, Murray Tepper, decides to spend his days plugging meters so he can sit in his car reading newspapers and waive off suitors hopeful of gaining his spot, little does he know that his odd behavior (even by New York standards) will set off a media buzz, provide him with cult-hero status, and incur reproach from the paranoid, dour Mayor Frank Ducavelli, who focuses on curtailing Tepper's "abuse" of the parking meter system. <p> Granted, the plot of this novel is quite thin, but, while not leaving you in stitches, Trillin provokes many smirks and smiles with his wit. For instance, he writes of magazines titled <i>Beautiful Spot: A Magazine of Parking</i> and the potential of <i>Spin: The Magazine of Salad Drying</i>. When Tepper suggests that his friend Jack leave his car's flashers on while parked illegally, Jack responds: </p><blockquote>And draw attention to myself? Not a chance. I always park in front of hydrants. The secret is to park smack in front of them rather than just too near them. You have to go all the way. If you're smack in front of them, the cop rolling down the street can't see that there's a hydrant there at all. You have to be brazen. That's my motto, in parking and in life: be brazen.</blockquote> Trillin's book should appeal to commuters and city dwellers everywhere, and anyone else looking for a chuckle. <i>--Michael Ferch</i>&#x201c;Good for smiles, guffaws, and sometimes laughter that brings tears.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;The Boston Globe<br><br>&#x201c;Beginning, middle, and end are equally charming....Nothing can take away from this novel&#x2019;s delight.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;The Washington Post<br><br>&#x201c;[Told] with great, cranky affection [and] an irresistible way of mixing the quotidian with the absurd.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;The New York Times<br><br> &#x201c;Trillin is at his charmingly funny best in this good-humored satire.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Los Angeles Times<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Beginning Arithmetic: Grade 1, Teacher&#39;s Manual</h2><p>One hardcover teacher&#39;s manual covers the whole course.

Winner of more than 70 tournaments, including the 1986 and 1993 British Opens, he has reigned as the world's number-one-ranked golfer for most of a decade and began 1998 as the PGA Tour's career-earnings leader with almost $12 million. As ruthless in the boardroom as he is on the golf course, the Shark turned a $2 million stake in Cobra Golf into a payoff of more than $40 million, bought a Boeing 747 jet for his personal use, and launched a clothing line bearing his multicolored-shark motif.</p><p>Three parts Crocodile Dundee, two parts Jack Nicklaus, and one part Don Quixote, the jet-setting Shark is larger than life. He has raced Ferraris with Nigel Mansell, hauled marlin over the side of plunging boats, scuba dived with sharks, taken a joyride in an F-14, saved drowning friends, and entertained a US president at his Florida compound. Yet Norman stands blond head and broad shoulders above golf's elite as the sport's most notorious victim of cruel calamity. His dramatic losses at the 1986 PGA Championship, the 1987 Masters, and the 1996 Masters rank among golf's most inexplicable defeats rendered by the most outrageous strokes of misfortune.</p><p>In this riveting and revealing biography, internationally acclaimed journalist Lauren St. John examines Norman's conquests as well as his failures and his relationships with his father, his agents, fellow golfers, and caddies. Using her unparalleled access to dozens of people who know Norman best, including the Shark himself, St. John explains how Norman's fear of bankruptcy drove him to win the 1986 British Open; exclusively reveals the background of the break-up with his first manager and his subsequent split with IMG; tells why golf's greatest natural talent has so often snatched defeat from the jaws of victory; and explains his tempestuous relationships with Jack Nicklaus and other top players.</p></p><p>One of golf's more outsized characters, Norman is a true sporting enigma: an athlete whose enormous defeats are far more dramatic--and interesting--than his considerable victories. Despite two British Open titles and more than 50 tournament wins worldwide, his legend--built on a go-for-broke playing style--has been cemented by his painfully unforgettable collapses in the three majors played on American soil. St. John, the golf correspondent for the <i>London Sunday Times</i>, works hard to get a grip on Norman's charismatic personality and how his inability to check that personality defines his game.Australian golfer Norman is considered one of the most gifted individuals to play his sport, even though in 22 years as a pro he has won only two major tournaments and had 52 second-place finishes, many of them in major events and many by a single stroke. While sports reporters have often described him as someone who "chokes" in a crisis, St. John, a golf writer for the Sunday Times of London, argues that his aggressive style of play does not let him rest content with a safe par when a flamboyant birdie is more appealing. This seems an outgrowth of Norman's childhood; he grew up as an indifferent student but a dedicated athlete, particularly devoted to surfing. But if his personal quirks have handicapped him on the links, they have proved valuable financially; one business deal netted him more than $40 million, and he has often earned $10 million a year in endorsements. His people skills have been far less successful, for he has fired two managers and virtually every caddie who worked with him. St. John gives readers an even-handed portrait.

First published almost twenty years ago, it made women's voices heard, in their own right and with their own integrity, for virtually the first time in social scientific theorizing about women. Its impact was immediate and continues to this day, in the academic world and beyond. Translated into sixteen languages, with more than three-quarters of a million copies sold around the world. <i>In a Different Voice</i> has inspired new research, new educational initiatives, and political debate-and helped many women and men to see themselves and each other in a different light. </p><p> Carol Gilligan believes that psychology has persistently and systematically misunderstood women--their motives, their moral commitments, the course of their psychological growth, and their special view of what is important in life. Here she sets out to correct psychology's misperceptions and refocus its view of female personality. The result is truly <i>a tour de force</i>, which may well reshape much of what psychology now has to say about female experience. </p></p><p><b>Carol Gilligan</b> is University Professor at the New York University School of Law.Theories of moral development are not mere abstractions.

In her 1982 book <i>In a Different Voice</i>, Carol Gilligan, a psychologist at Harvard University, wrote about the powerful messages young girls receive from those around them.

They also learn...to value relationships more than rules.<br> --T.

Robbins grimly recounts the merciless determination of the German and Soviet combatants of the battle of Stalingrad in <i>War of the Rats</i>. Drawing from real events, Robbins tells the story of one of the battle's most pivotal contests: the famous sniper duel between Chief Master Sergeant Vasily Zaitsev and S.S. Colonel Heinz Thorvald. Zaitsev, a cunning Siberian hunter hardened by Stalingrad's butchery, has formed an impromptu sniper school in the midst of the battle, training his comrades to kill with implacable efficiency. The hundreds of bodies left in their wake prompt the Nazi leadership to send Thorvald, the cold-blooded master of the Wehrmacht's elite sniper academy, to assassinate the Soviet prodigy. Robbins's nerve-wracking prose depicts the two adversaries as they pursue their private war across a twisted hellscape of burning tanks and gutted factories. In the novel's most impressive section, Robbins leaps between the thoughts of Zaitsev and Thorvald as they struggle, in their final battle, to put the crosshairs on each other's head.

He contributes monumentally to our understanding of war and remembrance."<br>--The Boston Globe<br>Throughout his childhood Eric Lomax possessed a passion for trains. In an ironic twist of fate, he was captured by the Japanese during World War II and sent to Thailand to work on the infamous Burma-Siam railroad, the barbaric project that claimed the lives of 250,000 men. There he constructed a radio to bring news of the war and secretly drew a map of the railroad. For this, Lomax suffered brutal and incessant torture and interrogation. Standing by through it all was Nagase Takashi, a young Japanese soldier who translated the captor's questions and Lomax's replies. Fifty years later, Lomax sought out this Japanese tormentor, meeting him on a hillside overlooking the River Kwai Bridge. But Lomax's object in meeting Takashi again was not revenge. It was reconciliation.<br>Here is a remarkable true story of forgiveness--a tremendous testament to the courage that propels one toward remembrance, and finally, peace with the past.

A railroad buff since a child, he took strange pleasure in his work as a POW on the Burma-Siam Railroad, which was later the subject of the film Bridge Over the River Kwai. When his captors discovered his detailed drawings of the railway, he was suspected as a spy and tortured for years. Fifty years later he discovered that the interpreter during his tortures was still alive. The two arranged a meeting and Lomax forgave him. Here is the exciting, moving and truthful account.Winner of the 1996 NCR Book Award <br>A naive young man, a radio enthusiast and radio buff, was caught up in the fall of the British Empire at Singapore in 1942. He was put to work on the Railway of Death -- the Japanese line from Thailand and Burma. The most disastrous engineering project in history, it killed 250,000 Allied prisoners and Thai labourers. Lomax helped to build a radio so that he and his comrades could follow news of the war. The radio was discovered and he was brutally tortured. One of his tormentors was a young Japanese interpreter; Lomax never forgot him. Despite an outwardly successful life, Lomax was emotionally ruined by his experiences and could never share them with anyone. Almost fifty years after the war, his life was changed by the discovery that his interrogator, the Japanese interpreter, was still alive.

He lifted an iron cot covering a pit under one of the tents, and there he found the blackened, swollen bodies of eleven children and two women. The news was flashed swiftly to the world. The tragedy was given a name: the Ludlow Massacre. <br><br> Some Americans know about the Ludlow Massacre, though it does not appear in most of the history texts used in our schools and colleges. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about it, a dark, brooding song. But few know that the Ludlow Massacre was the central event in a fourteen-month strike of coal miners that took a toll of at least sixty-six lives&#x2014;a strike which is one of the most dramatic and violent events in the history of this country. <br><br> Two governmental committees subsequently recorded over five thousand pages of firsthand testimony by participants in the Colorado coal strike. Thousands of newspaper stories and hundreds of magazine articles dealt with the conflict. Some of the most fascinating figures in American history were involved in some way in that event: Mother Jones and Eugene Debs, Woodrow Wilson, John D. Rockefeller and Ivy Lee, Upton Sinclair and John Reed. <br><br> Yet that story has been buried, in the way that labor struggles in general have been omitted or given brief mention in most mainstream accounts of the history of the United States. It deserves to be recalled, because embedded in the events of the Colorado strike are issues still alive today: the class struggle between owners of large enterprises and their workers, the special treatment of immigrant workers, the relationship between economic power and political power, the role of the press, and the way in which the culture censors out certain historical events.<br> The Colorado strike took place in a physical setting of vast proportions and staggering beauty. Down the center of the rectangle that is Colorado, from north to south, march an array of huge, breathtaking mountains&#x2014;the Rockies&#x2014;whose naked cliffs merge, on their eastern edge, with low hills covered with cedar and yellow pine. To the east of that is the plain&#x2014;really a mile-high plateau&#x2014;a tawny expanse of pasture grass sprinkled with prairie flowers in the spring and summer, and gleaming here and there with yellow- blossomed cactus. <br><br> Beneath the tremendous weight of the Rockies, in the course of countless centuries, decaying vegetation gradually mineralized into the black rock known as coal. The constantly increasing proportion of carbon in this rock transformed it from vegetable matter to peat, then to lignite and bituminous coal, and finally to anthracite. <br><br> Three great coalfields, consisting chiefly of bituminous coal, were formed in Colorado. One of them was contained within two counties in southern Colorado, Las Animas and Huerfano counties, just east of the mountains. This field was made up of about forty discontinuous seams, ranging from a few inches to fourteen feet thick. These seams were from two hundred and fifty to about five hundred feet deep. <br><br> The mining of these fields became possible on a large scale only in the 1870s, when the railroads moving west from Kansas City, south from Denver, and north from New Mexico, converged on the region. At about this time, settlers moving down the old Santa Fe trail built a town on the banks of the Purgatory River (el Rio de las Animas Perdidas Purgatorio&#x2014;the river of lost souls), just east of the Sangre de Cristo (blood of Christ) mountains and about fifteen miles north of the New Mexican border. <br><br> The town was called Trinidad, and it became the center of the southern mining area. By 1913 it had about ten thousand people&#x2014;miners, ranchers, farmers, and businessmen. From the main highways and railroad lines leading north out of Trinidad, branch railways and old wagon roads cut sharply west into the foothills of the mountains, into the steep-walled canyons where the mining camps lay. Scattered in these narrow canyons, on the flat bands of earth running along the canyon bottoms, were the huts of the miners, the mine buildings, and the mine entries. <br><br> It was a shocking contrast: the wild beauty of the Colorado countryside against the unspeakable squalor of these mining camps. The miners' huts, usually shared by several families, were made of clapboard walls and thin- planked floors, with leaking roofs, sagging doors, broken windows, and layers of old newspapers nailed to the walls to keep out the cold. Some families, particularly Negro families, were forced to live in tiny squares not much bigger than chicken cooops. <br><br> Within sight of the huts were the coke ovens and the mine tipple, where coal was emptied from the cars that carried it to the surface. Thick cloudsssss of soot clogged the air and settled on the ground, strangling any shoots of grass or flowers that tried to grow there. Wriggling along the canyon wall, behind the huts, was a now sluggish creek, dirty yellow and laden with the slag of the mine and the refuse of the camp. Alongside the creek the children played, barefoot, ragged, and often hungry. <br><br> Each mining camp was a feudal dominion, with the company acting as lord and master. Every camp had a marshal, a law enforcement officer paid by the company. The "laws" were the company's rules. Curfews were imposed, "suspicious" strangers were not allowed to visit the homes, the company store had a monopoly on goods sold in the camp. The doctor was a company doctor, the schoolteachers hired by the company. <br><br> In the early dawn, cages carried the men down into the blackness of the mine. There was usually a main tunnel, with dozens of branch tunnels leading into the "rooms," held up by timbers, where the miners hacked away at the face of the coal seam with hand picks and their helpers shoveled the coal into waiting railroad cars. The loaded cars were drawn along their tracks by mules to the main shaft, where they were lifted to the surface, and then to the top of the tipple, and then the coal showered down through the sorting screens into flatcars. <br><br> Since the average coal seam was about three feet high, the miners would often work on their knees or on their sides, never able to straighten up. The ventilation system was a crude affair that depended on the manipulation of tunnel doors by "trapper boys"&#x2014;often thirteen or fourteen years old&#x2014;who were being initiated into the work.<br> The first to labor in the Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Company's mines were Welshmen and Englishmen who had gained their experience in their mother countries. But with the great waves of immigration from southern Europe in the 1880s and 1890s, these were joined by Italians, Greeks, Poles, Hungarians, Montenegrins, and Serbs. There was also a large proportion of Mexicans and Negroes. <br><br> It was a man in charge of the "Sociological Department" of Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron who described the mine bosses and camp officials this way: "At the bottom of the pit with pick and shovel the miner frequently found a grafting pit boss on his back. The camp superintendents as a whole impress me as most uncouth, ignorant, immoral, and in many instances the most brutal set of men that we have ever met. Blasphemous bullies." <br><br> Political power in Colorado rested in the hands of those who held economic power. This meant that the authority of Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron and the other mine operators was virtually supreme. A letter from company manager L. M. Bowers to the secretary of John D. Rockefeller Jr., written in May of 1913, describes the situation:<br>The Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Company for many years was accused of being the political dictator of southern Colorado, and in fact was a mighty power in the whole state. When I came here it was said that the C. F. &amp; I. voted every man and woman in their employ without any regard to their being naturalized or not; and even their mules, it used to be remarked, were registered, if they were fortunate enough to possess names.... The company became notorious in many sections for their support of the liquor interests. They established saloons everywhere they possibly could.... A sheriff, elected by the votes of the C. F. &amp; I. Co. employees ... established himself or became a partner in sixteen liquor stores in our coal mines.<br> The Colorado attorney general who conducted an investigation in Huerfano County in the fall of 1913, on the eve of the strike, said, "I found a very perfect political machine, just as much a machine as Tammany in New York." Another letter, from Superintendent Bowers to Rockefeller shortly after the strike began, describes the cooperation of the bankers and the governor against the strike, and refers to Governor Ammons (a Democrat and a supporter of President Woodrow Wilson) as "our little cowboy governor." <br><br> Colorado's deputy labor commissioner, Edwin Brake, later testified before the House Mines and Mining subcommittee that investigated the strike, "It's very seldom you can convict anyone in Huerfano County if he's got any friends. Jeff Farr, the sheriff, selects the jury and they're picked to convict or acquit as the case may be." <br><br> A Reverend Atkinson, who interviewed Governor Ammons during the strike, asked the governor if there was constitutional law and government in Colorado, to which Ammons replied, "Not a bit in those counties where the coal mines are located." <br><br> Company officials were appointed as election judges. Company-dominated coroners and judges prevented injured employees from collecting damages. Polling places were often on company property. J. C. Baldwin, gambler and bartender, was jury foreman in 80 percent of the cases tried in his county. <br><br> Much of the land on which these camps stood had been acquired under dubious...</p><h2>Hershey&#39;s 1934 Cookbook</h2><p>In 1934 Hersey published its own chocolate cookbook, filled with all kinds of wonderful chocolate desserts. it is from this source that many of the recipes have been taken and brought up to date for you to use today.

Charles Nicholl is less interested in the poet's texts than in ``the reports of snoops and spies, in Privy Council papers and criminal charge-sheets.... This all happened a long time ago, but I believe it was a case of murder.... We can dig away some of the lies, and perhaps find beneath them a faint preserved outline where the truth once lay.'' Marlowe (1564-93) was killed after spending a day at Bull's with three nasty gents: Ingram Frizer, a crafty loan shark who did the actual stabbing and was acquitted for it; Frizer's dupe, Nicholas Skeres, who seems to have been a government intelligence agent in the pay of the Earl of Essex; and Robert Poley, a sinister, complex double-dealer, informer, agent provocateur and rumored poisoner, called by some ``the very genius of the Elizabethan underworld.'' Nicholl takes as a red herring an imputation by informer Richard Baines that Marlowe was gay, adding that we ``do not know what it meant to be gay in Elizabethan England.'' Baines also accused Marlowe of counterfeiting, of spreading heresies, atheism, and the slander that Christ was a sodomite with St. John, adding that Marlowe--a danger to Christianity--should have his mouth stopped. And Marlowe's dying of plague--another red herring? After carrying us through factions, fictions, and knaveries, Nicholl gives his vision of the murder. The vision is swathed in gauze and sultry with wine, but it sounds plausible and addresses the dark political context leading back to Her Majesty's Privy Council. A fine job of research that could quash forever the myth that Marlowe died in a ``tavern brawl.'' -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Elizabethan playwright-poet Marlowe was stabbed to death in 1593 at the age of 28, supposedly in a dispute over a tavern bill or "reckoning." In a painstaking piece of scholarship that reads like an intricate detective thriller, British author Nicholl argues that Marlowe was murderd by a court cabal orchestrated by Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, who viewed dramatist-spy Marlowe as an obstacle to his political ambitions. One of the three men with Marlowe the day he died, Nicholas Skeres, was a servant of Devereux; another, Robert Poley, was a government agent who earlier had played a major role in a covert operation to entrap and eliminate the imprisoned Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots. The third, a shady entrepreneur named Ingram Frizer, was the hit man. Nicholl, who goes much further than previous biographers in exploring Marlowe's connections to espionage, concludes that he was a government spy, recruited while a Cambridge student, who informed on subversive Catholic loyalists. Winner of both the British James Tait Black Prize for biography and the Crime Writers' Association Gold Dagger Award, this highly speculative study provides an extraordinary glimpse of the seamy Elizabethan underworld of espionage replete with double agents, disinformation, torture and murder.

The very thin. Hermaphrodites. Conjoined twins. The disabled. The very hirsute. In American history, all have shared the platform equally, as freaks, human oddities, their only commonality their assigned role of anomalous other to the gathered throngs. For the price of a ticket, freak shows offered spectators an icon of bodily otherness whose difference from them secured their own membership in a common American identity--by comparison ordinary, tractable, normal.</p> <p>Rosemarie Thomson's groundbreaking anthology probes America's disposition toward the visually different. The book's essays fall into four main categories: historical explorations of American freak shows in the era of P.T. Barnum; the articulation of the freak in literary and textual discourses; contemporary relocations of freak shows; and theoretical analyses of freak culture. Essays address such diverse topics as American colonialism and public presentations of natives; laughing gas demonstrations in the 1840's; Shirley Temple and Tom Thumb; Todd Browning's landmark movie Freaks; bodybuilders as postmodern freaks; freaks in Star Trek; Michael Jackson's identification with the Elephant Man; and the modern talk show as a reconfiguration of the freak show. In her introduction, Thomson traces the freak show from antiquity to the modern period and explores the constitutive, political, and textual properties of such exhibits.</p> <p><b>Freakery</b>is a fresh, insightful exploration of a heretofore neglected aspect of American mass culture.</p></p><p><p><b>Rosemarie Garland Thomson</b> is Assistant Professor of English at Howard University. </p><p>"The release of <b>Freakery</b> is as much a comment on modern academia as it is an intriguing exploration of the enduring fascination with the construction and presentation of those "who have been coarsely categorized as 'freaks,' 'curiosities', prodigies' and 'monstrosities.'"</p>-<i>Ethnologies</i></p><h2>Big Book of Quick Rotary Cutter Quilts</h2><p>Presents illustrations and step-by-step instructions on creating quilts from assembly to finishing touches, and includes tips on materials, quick piecing, and adding borders.</p><p>Big Book of Quick Rotary Cutter Quilts is for people who want to make quilts that are fun, hip, and a little different.

Its natural beauty attracts thousands of visitors every year, yet the county also is home to San Quentin Prison, one of the oldest and largest penitentiaries in the country. Marin ranks in the top one percent of counties nationwide in terms of affluence and overall health, yet it is far above the norm in drug overdoses and alcoholism, and comprises a large percentage of suicides from the Golden Gate Bridge.<br> <br>Ken Holmes worked in the Marin County Coroner&#x2019;s Office for thirty-six years, starting as a death investigator and ending as the three-term, elected coroner. As he grew into the job&#x2014;which is different from what is depicted on television&#x2014;Holmes learned a variety of skills, from finding hidden clues at death scenes, interviewing witnesses effectively, managing bystanders and reporters, preparing testimony for court to notifying families of a death with sensitivity and compassion. He also learned about different kinds of firearms, all types of drugs&#x2014;prescription and illegal&#x2014;and about certain unexpected and potentially fatal phenomena such as autoeroticism.<br> <br>Complete with poignant anecdotes, <i>The Education of a Coroner</i> provides a firsthand and fascinating glimpse into the daily life of a public servant whose work is dark and mysterious yet necessary for society to function.</p><p>John Bateson was executive director of a nationally certified crisis intervention and suicide prevention center in the San Francisco Bay Area for sixteen years. He is the author of three previous books&#x2014;<i>The Last and Greatest Battle</i>, <i>The Final Leap</i>, and <i>Building Hope</i>.The Education of a Coroner CHAPTER 01<p></p> FIRST BLUSH<p></p> <br>I first met Ken Holmes in 2010 when I interviewed him for my book The Final Leap, about suicides from the Golden Gate Bridge. I was executive director of a nationally certified crisis intervention and suicide prevention center in the San Francisco Bay Area at the time, and Ken&#x2019;s office was responsible for conducting the autopsies of most Golden Gate Bridge jumpers, as well as for notifying their families of the death. After the book came out, I was recruited to serve on the board of the Bridge Rail Foundation, an all-volunteer, nonprofit organization dedicated to ending suicides on the bridge. Ken was on the board also, and we had numerous opportunities to talk further. It didn&#x2019;t take long for me to realize that his experiences over nearly forty years in the Marin County Coroner&#x2019;s Office and the cases he&#x2019;d handled would make a riveting subject for a book.<br> <br>I had another reason for writing The Education of a Coroner: I didn&#x2019;t know much about the workings of a coroner&#x2019;s office, and wanted to learn more. How do coroners approach a death scene and what do they look for? How are families notified of a death, and what psychological techniques are employed? How has the world of forensic pathology changed with advances in technology?<br> <br>The first time Ken and I met to discuss it was in a brew pub in Larkspur, in central Marin County. He had been retired three years by that time, although he still had&#x2014;and continues to have&#x2014;frequent contact with many of his former colleagues, and also attends annual conferences of the California State Coroners Association, where he once was president. We had communicated by email before then and I had run my general idea by him. I would review eight hundred case files that he had preselected and copied onto electronic disks, then we would schedule a series of days when we would meet and discuss the cases that I thought were the most interesting. Along the way we also would talk about his background, training, responsibilities, lessons learned, and people he worked with. First, though, I said I needed to get a sense of whether the stories he told were compelling and had universal appeal.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; he said, and with no further prompting he launched into a thumbnail sketch of one case, then another and another until after only a few minutes my head was spinning. He apologized and said that once he started talking about his work, it was hard for him to stop.<br> <br>Holmes is a natural storyteller, and his deep, melodic voice is both authoritative and soothing. A barrel-chested man with sharp eyes&#x2014;even in his seventies&#x2014;strong hands from having spent years outdoors, and a handsome face framed by a trimmed gray beard, he is someone who makes friends easily and holds on to them because at the end of the day, and especially at this stage in his life, friends and family are what matter most. He is quick to laugh&#x2014;especially at himself&#x2014;and has a range of knowledge that is impressive. Whether it is medicine, politics, hunting, guns, home repair, sports, food, wine, or cars, he can hold his own in a conversation with anyone.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s back up,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;and focus on one case for now. You pick.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he said, and he proceeded to tell me some of the highlights of the Carol Filipelli case, which is described a little later in this book.<br> <br>At the end, all I could say was, &#x201c;How many more stories do you have like that?&#x201d;<br> <br>He shrugged and said, &#x201c;Dozens?&#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Some of the cases cast Holmes in the national spotlight because of who they involved&#x2014;rock legend Jerry Garcia, rapper Tupac Shakur, porn kings Jim and Artie Mitchell, and the infamous Trailside Killer. It was the deaths of people who weren&#x2019;t well known, however, that remain the most vivid and noteworthy in his mind.<br> <br>Several cases took nearly a decade to close, two took twenty years, one took thirty, and one took forty-four years. It might seem like a luxury for a coroner to be able to pursue cases so doggedly&#x2014;certainly that&#x2019;s not possible in large cities and statewide coroner&#x2019;s offices. In some respects it was, but Holmes&#x2019;s belief&#x2014;then and now&#x2014;is that family and friends of the deceased deserve to know what happened no matter how long it takes. Coroners deal with death, but their purpose is to find answers for the living.<br> <br>If the work of coroners were less dramatic, we wouldn&#x2019;t have so many TV shows about it. Holmes watches some of them and says that they get most&#x2014;though not all&#x2014;of the details right. Even so, inevitably he comes away thinking that real life is more moving than any fictionalized treatment can be. Nothing beats a story that happens to be true.<br> <br>It helps to have a glamorous setting, which is why the original CSI TV show was set in Las Vegas and there is now CSI: Miami, CSI: New York, and NCIS: Los Angeles. If the emphasis were on gritty, then we would have CSI: Camden, CSI: Detroit, and NCIS: Compton.<br> <br>The setting where Holmes worked is every bit as enthralling as the biggest cities with the brightest lights. I say that not because I was raised in Marin&#x2014;as an adolescent it didn&#x2019;t seem all that exciting&#x2014;but because the county has a national reputation, despite its small size. Part of that is due to its physical beauty. Situated just north of San Francisco, Marin is surrounded by water. The Pacific Ocean lies to the west, and the eastern and southern borders end at San Francisco Bay. Only the northern portion abuts land&#x2014;the beginning of California&#x2019;s legendary wine country. Otherwise, access is across the Golden Gate Bridge to the south or the Richmond&#x2013;San Rafael Bridge to the east.<br> <br>There are no large urban centers, processing plants, factories, or notable industries in Marin. Mostly the county consists of coastline, rolling hills, dairy farms, and small towns. Hundreds of thousands of people come every year to visit Point Reyes National Seashore, Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Muir Woods, Mount Tamalpais, Stinson Beach, Tomales Bay, and Samuel P. Taylor State Park.<br> <br>The other reason why Marin is well known is its affluence. It ranks among the top twenty counties in the United States in terms of household income, and is home to rock stars, movie stars, professional athletes, and wealthy business executives. The median price of homes is just under $1 million, and in many communities it&#x2019;s considerably more.<br> <br>This doesn&#x2019;t mean that all is rosy, however. In 2014, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation reported that nearly 25 percent of adults in Marin engage in binge drinking during any given month&#x2014;one of the highest averages in the state. More than thirty residents die per year from drug overdoses, a large number in a small county. In addition, Marin is second to San Francisco when it comes to suicides from the Golden Gate Bridge.<br> <br>Marin also has pockets of poverty. In the Canal District of San Rafael, people from dozens of cultures, speaking a multitude of languages, live close together in low-income housing. In Marin City, built during World War II to house shipyard workers and immigrants, local residents&#x2014;predominately African-American&#x2014;lived for years in crowded tenements until gentrification started pushing them out, creating new sources of tension.<br> <br>Then there is San Quentin Prison, the oldest prison in California and one of the largest penitentiaries in the United States. Built in 1852 on 432 acres of shoreline property in Marin, San Quentin is, almost certainly, the most expensive piece of real estate in America&#x2014;and perhaps the world&#x2014;that is devoted to housing convicted felons. In 2009 the land was estimated to be worth $2 billion, and it has only increased in value since then. All of California&#x2019;s 750 male death row inmates are locked up there, as well as more than four thousand other hardened criminals, male and female. To a motorist approaching Marin County from the Richmond&#x2013;San Rafael Bridge, the prison looks, at first glance, like a huge sand-colored hotel on the waterfront. As one gets closer, however, one sees the twelve-foot-high concrete walls that are topped by coils of electrified barbed wire, notices that all of the window openings are mere slits even though the view outside them is spectacular, and knows that San Quentin was built with a much different purpose in mind.<br> THE CORONER&#x2019;S OFFICE<p></p> <br>It&#x2019;s in this setting that the coroner&#x2019;s office in Marin County operates. Throughout Holmes&#x2019;s career, it was on the second floor of the Marin Civic Center in San Rafael, the county seat. The building was the last one designed by famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright and features a roof the color of the sky, scalloped balconies, and pink stucco walls, all intended to blend into the surrounding environment.<br> <br>The office, which has since moved, isn&#x2019;t what one might expect. Before I interviewed Holmes the first time, in 2010, I envisioned it to be part morgue with shrouded bodies laid out on stainless steel tables, waiting to be autopsied, and part laboratory with slides being inspected under microscopes. Like many small counties, however, Marin doesn&#x2019;t have a morgue because it&#x2019;s too expensive. Instead the coroner&#x2019;s office contracts with local mortuaries and private physicians to receive the bodies of dead people and conduct autopsies when warranted. The county also doesn&#x2019;t have a lab for analyzing specimens that are collected at a death scene. Fingernail scrapings, pubic hair samples, vaginal swabs, and the like are sent to outside labs. There are only a handful in California that specialize in this kind of analysis, with the primary one operated by the state Department of Justice. Samples from any case that might go to court&#x2014;particularly homicide cases&#x2014;are sent there. The DOJ lab doesn&#x2019;t handle body fluids, though, so blood, urine, and gastric samples are sent elsewhere.<br> <br>Employee offices look the same as the offices of any other business with a modest budget&#x2014;older desks and chairs, older computers and phones, and bookcases crammed with special texts, trade journals, binders, and miscellaneous papers. For all of Holmes&#x2019;s thirty-six years, there was a staff of seven. Six employees&#x2014;the coroner, assistant coroner, three death investigators, and a secretary&#x2014;were full-time. One position&#x2014;the medical transcriber&#x2014;was part-time. He or she took the voice recordings of forensic pathologists during autopsies and turned them into written summaries.<br> <br>The common areas are more distinctive. There are evidence lockers, an old bank safe to store money that is collected at a death scene, refrigeration units to store specimen samples, and dozens of four-drawer metal file cabinets that are filled with case files, some of which date back more than 150 years, to the time when California became a state.<br> <br>The role of the coroner originated in twelfth-century England. &#x201c;Crowners,&#x201d; as they were known at the time, conducted inquests on behalf of King Richard I to identify the deceased, determine how they died, and&#x2014;most important&#x2014;collect death taxes on their estates. It was the height of the Crusades, the Catholic Church was trying to restore Christianity in and around the Holy Lands, and money was needed to finance numerous campaigns.<br> <br>Coroner&#x2019;s offices today are vestiges of this royal system. Coroners are either elected by the populace or appointed by designated entities, with the requirements varying state by state and oftentimes county by county. In the highest form, coroners are medical examiners, meaning they are licensed physicians who are trained and certified in forensic pathology. Most people assume that all coroners are MEs, but this isn&#x2019;t the case. Many coroners are licensed physicians who have no training in forensics, while in hundreds of communities across the country&#x2014;including Marin County&#x2014;the coroner isn&#x2019;t required to have any medical training at all, much less a medical degree. He or she just needs to have a clean record, meaning no felony convictions, be twenty-one or older, and have a high school diploma. Some counties don&#x2019;t even require that, however. One county in Indiana elected a coroner who was eighteen and still in high school.<br> <br>A 2015 review by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine compared county coroners and medical examiners. The biggest benefit of county coroners, according to the review, is that they reflect the will of the people. In American political culture, elected officials represent a community&#x2019;s needs and values better than anyone else because they are chosen by voters. In addition, county coroners have equal footing with other locally elected officials&#x2014;members of the board of supervisors, sheriffs, judges, and district attorneys&#x2014;which enables them to operate independently from these entities. The main drawback is that the coroner may not be medically proficient since it&#x2019;s not a requirement of the job.<br> <br>On the medical examiner side, the major advantage, according to the review, is that the overall quality of death investigations is better. In addition, there is more uniformity. For statewide medical examiner offices, there are the added benefits of centralized administration, which is expensive to start but less expensive to sustain, and improved service to rural areas, which often don&#x2019;t have the capacity to operate coroner offices on their own.<br> <br>Nineteen states&#x2014;in general, the smallest ones&#x2014;have a state medical examiner system. The largest states, including California, Texas, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Georgia, have a mix of medical examiner and county coroner offices.<br> <br>As the most populous state, California is unusual&#x2014;but not unique&#x2014;in that the coroner&#x2019;s office is combined with the sheriff&#x2019;s department in forty-nine of fifty-eight counties. In these areas the sheriff serves as coroner, too&#x2014;despite having little or no medical training&#x2014;and appoints another law enforcement person to oversee the day-to-day duties who, in all likelihood, has no medical training, either. The result is that the work of the coroner&#x2019;s office is controlled by the sheriff, which can create problems. Because sheriffs focus on criminal activity, the emphasis of the coroner&#x2019;s office in these counties is to support homicide investigations. Less time is spent delving into deaths by accident, suicide, or natural causes, and frequently in these instances autopsies aren&#x2019;t conducted, in order to save money. Cases in which the manner of death is undetermined, but clearly isn&#x2019;t homicide, also get short shrift, leaving families in the dark as to what caused their loved one to die.<br> <br>The lack of national standards for coroners is hard to understand inasmuch as a death certificate is one of our most important documents. It is used by families to collect life insurance, file for payment from special funds for certain types of deaths, such as mesothelioma, and change names on deeds, trusts, and other valuable assets. Death certificates also are used by the government to stop Social Security payments, by businesses to change or eliminate pension payouts and health care coverage, by various public and private agencies to inform current funding decisions and future policies, and by researchers to track how society is changing.<br> <br>In Working Stiff: Two Years, 262 Bodies, and the Making of a Medical Examiner, author Judy Melinek talks about the value of a death certificate. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s no big deal if you don&#x2019;t have a birth certificate,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Other forms of identification will suffice to secure a job, open a bank account, even file for Social Security.

The candidate who tells the people what they want to hear is usually the one who wins&#x2014;facts be damned.<br> <br>Politicians may be sleazy and spineless, but they&#x2019;re not stupid. They see that the way to win is by first telling people everything that is wrong with the world, and then painting a vision of the life they want&#x2014;a Utopian vision that they&#x2019;ll create right here on earth, one where no one is ever sick or hungry, jobless, or homeless. All we have to do is surrender our freedom and someone else&#x2019;s wallet and they&#x2019;ll make it happen.<br> <br>And so they continue to lie, and we continue to believe them, and they keep winning elections.<br> <br>The only way to break the cycle is to understand why Americans fall for the deception over and over again. In <i>Liars</i>, #1 bestselling author and nationally syndicated radio host Glenn Beck reveals the startlingly simple answer: fear.<br> <br>At our most basic level, we&#x2019;re all afraid of something. Progressives from both parties exploit this by first pointing out the things we should be afraid of, and then offering us &#x201c;solutions&#x201d; to these fears. Solutions that always require us to give up our freedoms. Solutions that are based on two things: lies, and an unrelenting hunger for power and control.<br> <br>In his signature no-holds-barred way, Beck destroys the false promises of Progressivism and takes us through its history, showing how each &#x201c;wave&#x201d; built up on the one before it, ultimately washing up to the beach in the form of Barack Obama&#x2014;and whoever is next.</p><p>Glenn Beck, the nationally syndicated radio host and founder of TheBlaze television network, has written thirteen #1 bestselling books and is one of the few authors in history to have had #1 national bestsellers in the fiction, nonfiction, self-help, and children&#x2019;s picture book genres.

(Newark <i>Star-Ledger</i>) and ?immensely entertaining? (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>), with ?enough derring-do, romance and action to satisfy Griffin?s legions of fans and bring him new ones? (<i>Rocky Mountain News</i>). The new book is his best yet. August 6, 1943: In his brief career in the Office of Strategic Services, twenty-four-year-old Cletus Frade has already been involved in a lot of unusual situations, but nothing like the one he?s in now, standing with a German lieutenant colonel named Wilhelm Frogger in a Mississippi prisoner-of-war detention facility. Frade?s job? To help Frogger escape.<br><br> Frogger?s parents are in Frade?s custody in Argentina, because of their involvement in a secret German plan to establish safe havens for senior Nazi officials in South America, and the younger Frogger has agreed to help find out what they know. Even more important, however, is the secret within the secret. Before he was captured in Africa, Frogger was part of a conspiracy; its goal: to assassinate Adolf Hitler. If the OSS can use his knowledge and connections to nudge that plot along, even just a little bit? they may be able to end this war right now. But Frade is not the only one who knows about the Froggers. Even as he stands there in Mississippi, a troop of Germans and Argentinians, led by a Colonel Juan Perï¿½n, is on its way to kill the parents and, after them, Frade himself. His career in the OSS may have been brief?but it may just be about to be over. Filled with the special flair that Griffin?s fans have come to expect, <i>The Honor of Spies</i> is another rousing adventure from one of our finest storytellers.</p><p><b>W.E.B.

Nor did heknow who operated the estancia&#x2019;s eight slaughterhouses, of which Frigorï¿½ficoMorï¿½n had been one of the smallest, until recently, when Frigorï¿½fico Morï¿½n hadbeen shut down to make room for the runways and hangars of South AmericanAirways.</p><p>The car and the truck slowed and turned off the macadam road onto a narrowerroad of crushed stone, then stopped when they came to a sturdy closedgate, above which a sign read Casa Chica.</p><p>A sturdy man in his fifties with a full, immaculately trimmed cavalryman&#x2019;smustache got out of the car and walked toward the gate, holding in his hand akey to the massive padlock that secured the chains in the gate.</p><p>He had just twisted the key in the lock when a man on horseback trottedup, holding a rifle vertically, its butt resting on the saddle. Without speakingto him&#x2014;which the man on horseback correctly interpreted to be a signal ofdisapproval; he knew he should have been at the gate before the man with themustache reached it&#x2014;the man returned to the Ford. He got in and waitedfor the peon to get off the horse and finish dealing with the chain and swingopen the gate.</p><p>When the car and truck had passed through the gate, the peon went to theright post of the gate, pulled a piece of canvas aside, and then knelt beside anArgentine copy of the U.S. Army&#x2019;s EE-8 field telephone. He gave its crank severalhard turns, then stood up, holding the headset to his ear as he looked upthe steep hill to Casa Chica.</p><p>An identical field telephone rang in the comfortable living room of CasaChica, a bungalow sitting near the crest of the hill.</p><p>There were five people in the room. A middle-aged balding man wearing asweater over his shirt sat across a desk from a younger man wearing a looselyknit white turtleneck sweater. A Thompson submachine gun hung from theback of the younger man&#x2019;s chair.</p><p>Another rifle-armed peon&#x2014;this one leaning back in a chair that restedagainst a wall&#x2014;had been on the edge of dozing off when the telephone rang. Alarge, even massive, dark-skinned woman in her thirties sat on a couch acrossfrom a middle-aged woman in an armchair, who was looking bitterly at themiddle-aged balding man at the desk. When the telephone rang, the largewoman rose with surprising agility from the couch and went to it.</p><p>The balding man stopped what he was doing, which was working on an organizationalchart, and looked at the massive woman.</p><p>&#x201c;You just keep on working, Herr Frogger,&#x201d; the young man said not verypleasantly in German.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have all these details in my memory, Major,&#x201d; Frogger said.</p><p>&#x201c;Try harder,&#x201d; the young man said coldly.</p><p>He was Sergeant Sigfried Stein, U.S. Army, although Herr Wilhelm Froggerand his wife, Else, had been told&#x2014;and believed&#x2014;that he was a major.</p><p>Until weeks before, Wilhelm Frogger had been the commercial attachï¿½ ofthe German Embassy in Buenos Aires. On the fourth of July, he had then appearedat the apartment of Milton Leibermann, a &#x201c;legal attachï¿½&#x201d; of the U.S.Embassy, and offered to exchange his knowledge of German Embassy secretsfor sanctuary in Brazil.</p><p>Leibermann was <i>de facto</i> the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x2019;s man in Argentina.He had no place to hide the German defectors from either the Germansor the Argentine authorities&#x2014;who, he knew, would be told the Froggershad been kidnapped&#x2014;nor any means to get the defectors out of Argentina. Sohe had turned them over to someone he thought could do both.</p><p>He knew that Don Cletus Frade, patrï¿½n of Estancia San Pedro y SanPablo, was in fact a U.S. Marine Corps major and the <i>de facto</i> head of theU.S. Office of Strategic Services in Argentina. He also knew that having anydealings at all with anyone connected with the spies of the OSS had been absolutelyforbidden by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, and for that reasonLeibermann had not reported to the FBI that the Froggers had come to him,or what he had done with them.</p><p>Frade was interested in the Froggers because he knew more of the secretactivities of the German Embassy than Frogger thought he could possiblyknow, most importantly about something the Germans called &#x201c;OperationPhoenix.&#x201d;</p><p>Frogger steadfastly denied any knowledge of Operation Phoenix, whichconvinced Frade he was a liar. It had also become almost immediately apparentthat Frau Else Frogger was an unrepentant National Socialist who not onlyhad decided that defecting had been a mistake but that if they could only getaway from Frade and his <i>gottverdammt Jude</i>&#x2014;&#x201c;Major&#x201d; Stein&#x2014;all would be forgiven at the German Embassy.</p><p>Frade, however, knew enough about the SS officers in the German Embassyto know that before or after the Froggers were returned to Germany to enter aconcentration camp they would be thoroughly interrogated about Leibermannand about Frade&#x2019;s operation. And the Froggers had seen too much to let thathappen.</p><p>Letting them go was not an option.</p><p>Frade had no immediate means of getting them even to Brazil without takingunjustifiable risks. So while they were, so to speak, in limbo, he was hidingthem on a small farm that his father had used for romantic interludes in thecountry.</p><p>There was a chance that Siggie Stein could break down one of them&#x2014;orboth&#x2014;and get them to reveal what they knew about Operation Phoenix. Notmuch of a chance, though, for Stein was a demolitions man turned communications/cryptography expert, not a trained interrogator. Still, on the otherhand, he was a refugee from Nazi Germany, and had some relatives who&#x2019;d notbeen able to escape and had perished in concentration camps.</p><p>The massive Argentine woman, who was known as &#x201c;The Other Dorotea&#x201d;&#x2014;Don Cletus Frade&#x2019;s Anglo-Argentine wife was Doï¿½a Dorotea Mallï¿½n de Frade&#x2014;listened to the telephone and then reported, &#x201c;It is Suboficial Mayor Rodrï¿½guez.&#x201d;Stein rose from his chair, picking up the Thompson.</p><p>&#x201c;Watch them,&#x201d; he said to the peon with the rifle, then turned to HerrFrogger and said, &#x201c;Keep at it,&#x201d; and then walked out of the room and onto theverandah to wait for Rodrï¿½guez.</p><p>The incline in front of Casa Chica was very steep, and between the houseand the road and gate, but not visible from either, a landing strip had beencarved out of the hillside. Frade had told Stein his father had used it to flyhis lady love into the house in one of Estancia San Pedro y San Pablo&#x2019;s fleet ofPiper Cubs.</p><p>The car and the truck appeared a moment later, moving slowly in low gear,and turned onto the landing strip. When they stopped, Suboficial Mayor EnricoRodrï¿½guez&#x2014;who had been Cavalry, Ejï¿½rcito Argentino, and had retiredwith the late Coronel Jorge Frade from the Hï¿½sares de Pueyrredï¿½n, Argentina&#x2019;smost prestigious cavalry regiment&#x2014;got out of the car and started toward thehouse, going up the stairs carved into the hillside. He carried a RemingtonModel 11 self-loading twelve-gauge riot shotgun in his hand.</p><p>The driver of the refrigerator truck got out from behind the wheel, went tothe rear doors, and pulled them open. A dozen peones, all armed with Mauserrifles, began to pile out of the truck and then to unload from it equipment, includingammunition cans, blankets, food containers, and finally a Browning AutomaticRifle.</p><p>Rodrï¿½guez put his arm around Stein&#x2019;s shoulders and pounded his back affectionately,but did not speak.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on, Sergeant Major?&#x201d; Stein asked in Spanish.</p><p>Their relationship was delicate. Rodrï¿½guez had a long service history and hadheld the senior enlisted rank for ten years of it. He knew that Stein had just beenpromoted to staff sergeant yet had been in the army not even two years. </p><p></p><p>On the other hand, Don Cletus Frade had made it clear to Rodrï¿½guez thatStein was in charge of the Froggers and Casa Chica.</p><p>&#x201c;I have had a telephone call from an old friend,&#x201d; Enrico Rodrï¿½guez said.</p><p>&#x201c;There are two trucks of Mountain Troops on their way here. They have withthem a half-dozen Nazi soldiers&#x2014;the ones who came off the submarine? Theones with the skulls on their caps?&#x201d;</p><p>Stein nodded his understanding.</p><p>&#x201c;What makes you think they&#x2019;re coming here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My friend, he is also of the Hï¿½sares, heard the Nazi officer tell his men theywere going after traitors to the Fï¿½hrer.&#x201d;</p><p>He mispronounced the title, and without thinking about it, Stein correctedhim and then asked, &#x201c;How would they know we have the Froggers here?&#x201d;Rodrï¿½guez shrugged.</p><p>&#x201c;We will defend them,&#x201d; Rodrï¿½guez said seriously.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what those guys are for?&#x201d; Stein asked, nodding down the stairs towardthe peones now milling around on the landing strip.</p><p>&#x201c;There are twelve, all old Hï¿½sares,&#x201d; Rodrï¿½guez said.</p><p>&#x201c;Sergeant Major, with the twelve we have here, that&#x2019;s two dozen. Againsthow many soldiers on two trucks?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Probably forty, forty-two,&#x201d; Rodrï¿½guez said. &#x201c;What I have been thinking isthat they are coming in such strength thinking we have only the dozen men,and they can make us give them the Froggers without a fight. If they see we areso many, they may decide that there will be a fight, and they know that if thereis a fight against us, there would be many casualties. How would they explainthe deaths of ten or fifteen Mountain Troops so far from their base?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sergeant Major, I think it would be best if there were no confrontation,&#x201d;Stein said carefully.</p><p>&#x201c;You mean just turn the Froggers over to them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. I mean get the Froggers out of here, back to someplace on EstanciaSan Pedro y San Pablo.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don Cletus said they were to be kept here in Casa Chica,&#x201d; Rodrï¿½guez said.</p><p>&#x201c;That was before he knew about this,&#x201d; Stein argued.</p><p>After a pause, the old soldier said, &#x201c;True.&#x201d;</p><p>Stein had to suppress a smile, both at the old soldier and at the Christianscripture that had for some inexplicable reason popped into his Jewish head:<i>Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.Ninety seconds ago</i>, he reminded himself, <i>I was asking myself whether I hadthe balls to shoot both of those goddamn Nazis rather than see them freed, and decidedthat I did.</i></p><p>&#x201c;You have some place to take them?&#x201d; Stein pursued.</p><p>&#x201c;I will tell the driver where to take you,&#x201d; Rodrï¿½guez said. &#x201c;And then latermeet you there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to take them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am going to stay here and see what these bastards are up to,&#x201d; Rodrï¿½guez said.</p><p>&#x201c;And so will I,&#x201d; Stein said, somewhat astonished to hear himself say it.</p><p>Rodrï¿½guez was visibly unhappy to hear this.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have a saying in the U.S. Army that there can only be onecommander?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sergeant Major, I recognize that your experience in matters like these ismuch greater than mine.&#x201d; <i>Which is practically nonexistent</i>. &#x201c;I am at your orders.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We will send six of the men, plus the driver, with the Froggers,&#x201d; Rodrï¿½guezordered as he assumed command. &#x201c;You tell The Other Dorotea to prepare theNazis to be moved. Tell her I said I want them tied and blindfolded.&#x201d;</p><p>Stein managed to keep himself from saying, <i>Yes, sir</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Got it,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;And while you&#x2019;re doing that, I will have the Ford car and your vehiclesmoved over there,&#x201d; he said, pointing to a line of hills that began a quarter of amile the other side of the road. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a dirt road. I want nothing in the housewhen they get here.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Why? What&#x2019;s that all about?</i></p><p>&#x201c;Good idea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I will set up my command post there,&#x201d; Rodrï¿½guez said, pointing.</p><p>&#x201c;Just below the military crest of the hill.&#x201d;</p><p><i>What the hell is &#x201c;the military crest of the hill&#x201d;?</i></p><p>Stein nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;And you have the little German camera Don Cletus brought from Brazil?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Leica,&#x201d; Stein said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s in the house.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We will need photos of everything that happens here to show Don Cletuswhen he returns. You would be useful doing that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll send two men with you down there,&#x201d; Rodrï¿½guez said, pointing to a roofless,windowless old building on the edge of the road about a hundred meters fromthe gate. &#x201c;I think you will be able to see both the house and the approaches, aswell as the road, from the upper story.&#x201d; He paused and chuckled. &#x201c;If there still isa second story. If not, you&#x2019;ll have to do as best you can from the ground floor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Understood.&#x201d;</p><p><i>While I am trying to take their pictures from the ground floor of a decrepit oldbuilding in the middle of Argentina, I am going to be shot to death by the SS.Jesus Christ!</i></p><p>Thirty minutes later, on the second floor of the old building, Staff SergeantStein sat patiently while one of the two old Hï¿½sares with him carefully paintedhis face, his hands, and whatever shiny parts of the Leica Ic camera with a mixtureof dust from the building and axle grease. They took extra care with thecamera so as not to render it useless.</p><p>When they had finished that, they draped Stein in a sort of shroud made from burlap potato bags, which covered his head and his body to his ankles.</p><p>Then, very carefully, they stuck a great deal of dead leafy vegetable matter intothe burlap shroud.</p><p>While he had been undergoing the transformation, the other old Hï¿½sar tookapart an Argentine copy of a U.S. Army EE-8 field telephone, disconnected thebells that would ring when another EE-8 was cranked, and then carefully putthe phone back together.</p><p>Then he communicated with four other old Hï¿½sares, plus SuboficialMayor Enrico Rodrï¿½guez, who had apparently stationed themselves in placesStein could not see, although he tried very hard.</p><p>And finally, they painted each other&#x2019;s faces with the axle grease and dustcompound, put on potato sack shrouds, and adorned these with dead leafyvegetation. One of them had a Mauser army rifle with a telescopic sight, andthe other a Thompson submachine gun like Stein&#x2019;s. They wrapped them withburlap, looked around, and then wrapped Stein&#x2019;s Thompson in burlap.</p><p>Twenty minutes after that, the man who had camouflaged Stein had a conversationover the telephone, which surprised Stein since he had not heard it ring,although he was no more than four feet from it. Then he remembered watchingthe man disconnect the bell.</p><p>&#x201c;Ten minutes, give or take,&#x201d; the old Hï¿½sar said conversationally.</p><p>The first vehicle to appear, five or six minutes later, was not the army truckStein expected from the west but a glistening, if olive-drab, Mercedes-Benzconvertible sedan. And it came down the road from the east.</p><p>It slowed almost to a stop at the intersection of the road to Casa Chica. Steinsaw that Colonel Juan D.

While she works on sabotaging her enemy and enlisting allies for battle, her friends face challenges of their own. Ling is in the hold of Rafe Mfeme's giant trawler, on her way to a prison camp. Becca meets up with Astrid and learns why the Ondalinian mermaid is always so angry: she is hiding a shameful secret. Ava can't return home, because death riders await her arrival. And it is getting more and more difficult for Mahdi, Serafina's betrothed, to keep up the ruse that he is in love with Lucia Volerno. If Lucia's parents become suspicious, his life--and all of Sera's hopes--will be extinguished. Political intrigue, dangerous liaisons, and spine-tingling suspense swirl like a maelstrom in this penultimate book in the WaterFire saga. <strong>Praise for <em>Deep Blue</em><br><br></strong>"A richly imagined novel.

I thought: <i>Oh! A psychic! Even if she&#x2019;s a fraud, that&#x2019;s still interesting.</i> But my characters have minds of their own and she only had a small part to play in that book &#x2014; yet she stayed with me. She&#x2019;s had a couple of books since then, three short stories, and in my upcoming INK AND BONE we meet her granddaughter Finley, who has powers of her own. Eloise&#x2019;s story has told itself in a way that I wouldn&#x2019;t have expected, and it has led me down some roads I didn&#x2019;t imagine I'd go as a writer. This is, of course, the joy and the magic of writing. So I was struck while reading PLAYING WITH FIRE that you, too, had walked into some of the same territory. Was it a character, or a story, or curiosity about something else that led you there?</p> <p><b>Tess Gerritsen:</b> It was a nightmare! I was in Venice for my birthday, and after a night drinking a bit too much wine, I had a freaky dream. I dreamt I was playing my violin. A baby was sitting nearby, and as I played a dark and disturbing melody, the baby's eyes suddenly glowed red and she turned into a monster. I woke up wondering what it meant -- and knowing there was a story here. Something about the power of music to haunt and to transform people. That day I wandered around Venice and ended up in the old Jewish quarter. There I saw memorial plaques dedicated to the Venice Jews who were deported to death camps during WWII. That's when both parts of the novel came to me -- a story about a 1930s Jewish composer whose haunting melody will nearly destroy the life of a woman violinist 70 years later. I'm already a violinist (strictly amateur) with a lifelong love of music, and that knowledge helped inform the musical aspects of the story.</p> <p>Was there anything from your own life that worked its way into INK AND BONE? Some part of yourself that slipped into the character or plot?</p> <p><b>Lisa Unger:</b> I have an enduring fascination with the idea of psychic phenomena in the Jungian sense, that it might be considered a natural extension of normal human ability. In my other life in publishing, I had a chance to work with psychic John Edwards. In a weird way, though this was many years ago, he was the inspiration for Eloise Montgomery. The fictional town in which INK AND BONE is set, The Hollows, first showed up in FRAGILE, which was very loosely based on a real event from my past. Though I didn&#x2019;t see it at the time, The Hollows shares certain similarities with the place where I grew up. So, in a lot of ways I suppose I&#x2019;m dreaming on the page, the real and the imagined get twisted into fiction.</p> <p><b>Tess Gerritsen:</b> I&#x2019;m intrigued by the fact your character in INK AND BONE was inspired by your work with psychic John Edwards. I love hearing about the research. It is the part I enjoy most about writing, because I can delve into new worlds. As a writer I've attended autopsies, watched the CT scan of a mummy, and scouted Boston for the best places to dump a body. What lengths have you gone to get the details right? </p> <p><b>Lisa Unger:</b> Most writers are explorers. I like to think of myself as a spelunker, shimming into the dark spaces between things I don&#x2019;t understand to try finding answers. So, yes, research (and life) is an important part of the process.</p> <p>I&#x2019;ve taken a concealed weapons course (and absolutely hated the feeling of firing a gun). I&#x2019;ve interviewed a woman who claimed to be a ghost hunter. One of my closest friends is a retired Federal Agent who, if he doesn&#x2019;t know the answers to my million questions, can always find someone who does. I lived with a New York City police officer for eight years &#x2013; okay, so that was a relationship, and a pretty bad one at that. But in the end I just wound up with a good knowledge of police work and fantastic recipe for roast pork -- which I guess is something. I&#x2019;ve been lava tubing in Iceland (not sure where that&#x2019;s going to turn up, but I&#x2019;m guessing it will). Recently, I&#x2019;ve become obsessed with birds. I&#x2019;m an information junkie. I&#x2019;m constantly reading non-fiction in all areas with a special focus on psychology, addiction, trauma, biology and the brain. For me, more than the nuts and bolts of procedure, its human nature and the mind, and where those things intersect with nurture and spirituality, that fascinate me. Much of INK AND BONE is laced through with those themes.</p> <p>What themes do you find come up again and again in your novels? Have you ever been surprised by a recurring question or idea that surfaces without your realizing it?</p> <p><b>Tess Gerritsen:</b> I too hated firing a gun. I was painfully aware that if I was the slightest bit careless and didn't stay in control of where it was pointed, someone could die. </p> <p>When I'm writing, I'm thinking primarily about characters and plot, and it's only in retrospect that I understand what the theme might be. You asked whether I've been surprised by recurring questions that seem to surface in my books, and the answer is: yes, absolutely. </p> <p>When I was a child, I adored a family friend named Uncle Mike, who served very much as a father figure for me. He was a gentle soul who counseled me about school, life, and love. Then when I turned eighteen, Uncle Mike was arrested for murdering his sister-in-law. I was stunned because I never saw that violent side of him, and it led me to question whether <i>anyone</i> is who they seem to be. That's the theme I return to again and again -- which smiling face hides the monster? In a way, it's a universal theme for crime writers, the evil that lurks in the hearts of seemingly ordinary human beings. </p> <p><b>Lisa Unger:</b> When I was fifteen, a girl I knew was abducted and murdered. We lived in a small, supposedly safe town, the kind of place you move to give your kids a happy, suburban upbringing. And then, on a day like any other day, a girl walking home from school fell victim to a monster. I never saw the world the same way again. The theme of the lost girl runs through almost all of my novels in one way or another, never with my intending it and always obvious to me only after the book is done. I think most of us are metabolizing fear on the page, and looking to put order to the chaos we perceive in the world. Maybe that&#x2019;s why people read crime fiction, as well &#x2014; because there&#x2019;s a beginning, middle, and an end where some kind of justice is served. Not always so in the real world.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m writing pretty close to the bone. I follow the voices in my head, and so far they&#x2019;ve all been pretty dark and twisted, wrestling with questions of identity, struggling with everything from addiction to body dysmorphic disorder to hauntings. I have a voracious curiosity about people and all the different things that make us who we are. If someone else turns up with something different to explore, I&#x2019;ll certainly honor that. For me that&#x2019;s the joy of writing, following character voice wherever it takes me.</p>Lisa Unger is an award-winning <i>New York Times</i> and internationally bestselling author.

Published to <b>celebrate the company's 60th anniversary</b>, author Matthew Plunkett relays a fascinating and engaging tale beginning with how&nbsp;Dick Fisher came to create Boston Whaler and then detailing&nbsp;how the company <b>evolved </b>over the decades.<br><br> From the original 13' hull, unflatteringly known as the &#x201c;blue bathtub,&#x201d; to its <b>current flagship, the 420 Outrage</b>, this book covers the whole story of a truly American company. Drawing on dozens of interviews with employees&nbsp;who were there in the plants, at the dealerships, and on the boats, <i>Unsinkable: The History of Boston Whaler</i> is filled with previously untold stories as well as never before published images, including photos from the families of Dick Fisher and legendary designer Bob Dougherty, Mr. Unsinkable himself.<br><br> This intimate look into the creation, culture, and ongoing legacy of Boston Whaler reveals just how influential this company has been both within the industry and for its legions of diehard fans around the world.</p><p><p><b>Matthew Plunkett </b>spent&nbsp;two years researching the history of the Boston Whaler company, from its humble origins in a garage in Braintree, Massachusetts, to its one-hundred-acre factory in Edgewater, Florida. In addition to combing through the written record of this company, Plunkett conducted more than three dozen interviews to pull together the Boston Whaler story. The book features never-before-seen photos and drawings to engage the reader and shed light on the history of this remarkable company.

They have been called this because they appear unexpectedly among the ruins of the past with no evidence of a preceding period of development; their technological sophistication seems far beyond the capabilities of ancient peoples. Drawing on the literature and art of the Chaldeans, Sumerians, Babylonians and others, Rene Noorbergen&#39;s contention is that a superior race of man was responsible for these scientific marvels that bear testimony to a civilization with technology comparable to our own.</p><p><b>Rene Noorbergen</b> was born in Groningen, the Netherlands, and educated at La Sierra College in California, and at the University of Groningen. <p>His writing assignments have been divided between Europe and this country.

In 1966, Mr. Noorbergen was named Managing Editor in the Publications Department of the Ford Motor Company. </p> <p>He has long been interested in phenomena which eludes scientific means of measurements, but which nevertheless have been shown to have validity.

He has also written the recent <i>You Are Psychic, The Story of David N. Bubar</i>. He also was roving editor on the staff of International Wildlife Magazine, and a war correspondent for various international publications.</p></p><h2>The Stand For the First Time Complete and Uncut</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY. A monumentally devastating plague leaves only a few survivors who, in a desert world, experience dreams of good and evil in confrontation and, through their choices, move toward an actual confrontation.</p><p>In 1978, science fiction writer Spider Robinson wrote a scathing review of <i>The Stand</i> in which he exhorted his readers to grab strangers in bookstores and beg them not to buy it.<p> <i>The Stand</i> is like that. You either love it or hate it, but you can't ignore it. Stephen King's most popular book, according to polls of his fans, is an end-of-the-world scenario: a rapidly mutating flu virus is accidentally released from a U.S. military facility and wipes out 99 and 44/100 percent of the world's population, thus setting the stage for an apocalyptic confrontation between Good and Evil.</p><p> "I <i>love</i> to burn things up," King says. "It's the werewolf in me, I guess.... <i>The Stand</i> was particularly fulfilling, because there I got a chance to scrub the whole human race, and man, it was fun! ... Much of the compulsive, driven feeling I had while I worked on <i>The Stand</i> came from the vicarious thrill of imagining an entire entrenched social order destroyed in one stroke."</p><p> There is much to admire in <i>The Stand</i>: the vivid thumbnail sketches with which King populates a whole landscape with dozens of believable characters; the deep sense of nostalgia for things left behind; the way it subverts our sense of reality by showing us a world we find familiar, then flipping it over to reveal the darkness underneath. Anyone who wants to know, or claims to know, the heart of the American experience needs to read this book. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>This is the way the world ends: with a nanosecond of computer error in a Defense Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form the links in a chain letter of death.<br><br>And here is the bleak new world of the day after: a world stripped of its institutions and emptied of 99 percent of its people. A world in which a handful of panicky survivors choose sides -- or are chosen. A world in which good rides on the frail shoulders of the 108-year-old Mother Abigail -- and the worst nightmares of evil are embodied in a man with a lethal smile and unspeakable powers: Randall Flagg, the dark man.<br><br>In 1978 Stephen King published <i>The Stand</i>, the novel that is now considered to be one of his finest works. But as it was first published, <i>The Stand</i> was incomplete, since more than 150,000 words had been cut from the original manuscript.<br><br>Now Stephen King's apocalyptic vision of a world blasted by plague and embroiled in an elemental struggle between good and evil has been restored to its entirety. <i>The Stand</i> : <i>The Complete And Uncut Edition</i> includes more than five hundred pages of material previously deleted, along with new material that King added as he reworked the manuscript for a new generation. It gives us new characters and endows familiar ones with new depths. It has a new beginning and a new ending. What emerges is a gripping work with the scope and moral comlexity of a true epic.<br><br>For hundreds of thousands of fans who read <i>The Stand</i> in its original version and wanted more, this new edition is Stephen King's gift. And those who are reading <i>The Stand</i> for the first time will discover a triumphant and eerily plausible work of the imagination that takes on the issues that will determine our survival.</p><h2>They Say We Are Infidels: On the Run from ISIS with Persecuted Christians in the Middle East</h2><p>&#x201c;Everywhere militants were blowing up Christians, their churches, their shops.

Drawing on previously untapped manuscript sources, the author refutes such long-standing myths as Stonewall Jackson&#39;s obsessive eating of lemons and gives a three-dimensional account of the profound religious faith frequently caricatured as grim Calvinism. Though the author capably covers the battles that made Jackson a legend--Sharpsburg, Fredericksburg, etc.--he emphasizes &#34;the life story of an extraordinary man.&#34; The result is a biography that will fascinate even those allergic to military history.The passage of 130 years has only deepened the fascination and reverence for Confederate general Thomas Jonathan &#34;Stonewall&#34; Jackson. He ranks today as among the half-dozen greatest soldiers that America has produced. Military academies in both hemispheres still teach his tactics. Revered by his men, respected by his foes, Jackson became seemingly invincible. When he learned of the general&#39;s fatal wound, Robert E. Lee sent his &#34;affectionate regards&#34;, saying, &#34;He has lost his left arm but I my right arm&#34;. Jackson&#39;s early death in 1863 was the greatest personal loss suffered by the Confederacy and one that permanently crippled the wartime South. This eagerly awaited biography is based on years of research into little-known manuscripts, unpublished letters, newspapers, and other primary sources. It offers for the first time a complete portrait - not only of Jackson the brilliant military strategist and beloved general but also of Jackson, the man of orphaned background, unyielding determination to conquer adversity, and deep religious convictions.</p><h2>Where&#39;s Waldo?

Hazel Soan, internationally successful artist and instructor, reveals the secrets of watercolor painting that are so often overlooked in the desire to capture likeness. By focusing on the practice and discipline of painting, artists will build confidence in their skills, which will lead to a more positive approach and to paintings that are both vibrant and exciting.</p><p>Hazel Soan is known to millions through her role as an Art Expert in Channel 4&#39;s popular painting programme Watercolour Challenge, and through her own series, Splash of Colour, made by Anglia TV.

Day 6.<br><br>Is today a good day to die?<br><br>This is something I ask myself in the morning when I wake up. In third period when I'm trying to keep my eyes open while Mr. Schroeder drones on and on. At the supper table as I'm passing the green beans. At night when I'm lying awake because my brain won't shut off due to all there is to think about.<br><br>Is today the day?<br><br>And if not today--when?<br><br>I am asking myself this now as I stand on a narrow ledge six stories above the ground. I'm so high up, I'm practically part of the sky. I look down at the pavement below, and the world tilts. I close my eyes, enjoying the way everything spins. Maybe this time I'll do it--let the air carry me away. It will be like floating in a pool, drifting off until there's nothing.<br><br>I don't remember climbing up here. In fact, I don't remember much of anything before Sunday, at least not anything so far this winter. This happens every time--the blanking out, the waking up. I'm like that old man with the beard, Rip Van Winkle. Now you see me, now you don't. You'd think I'd have gotten used to it, but this last time was the worst yet because I wasn't asleep for a couple days or a week or two--I was asleep for the holidays, meaning Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's. I can't tell you what was different this time around, only that when I woke up, I felt deader than usual. Awake, yeah, but completely empty, like someone had been feasting on my blood. This is day six of being awake again, and my first week back at school since November 14.<br><br>I open my eyes, and the ground is still there, hard and permanent. I am in the bell tower of the high school, standing on a ledge about four inches wide. The tower is pretty small, with only a few feet of concrete floor space on all sides of the bell itself, and then this low stone railing, which I've climbed over to get here. Every now and then I knock one of my legs against it to remind myself it's there.<br><br>My arms are outstretched as if I'm conducting a sermon and this entire not-very-big, dull, dull town is my congregation. "Ladies and gentlemen," I shout, "I would like to welcome you to my death!" You might expect me to say "life," having just woken up and all, but it's only when I'm awake that I think about dying.<br><br>I am shouting in an old-school-preacher way, all jerking head and words that twitch at the ends, and I almost lose my balance. I hold on behind me, happy no one seems to have noticed, because, let's face it, it's hard to look fearless when you're clutching the railing like a chicken.<br><br>"I, Theodore Finch, being of unsound mind, do hereby bequeath all my earthly possessions to Charlie Donahue, Brenda Shank-Kravitz, and my sisters. Everyone else can go f---- themselves." In my house, my mom taught us early to spell that word (if we must use it) or, better yet, not spell it, and, sadly, this has stuck.<br><br>Even though the bell has rung, some of my classmates are still milling around on the ground. It's the first week of the second semester of senior year, and already they're acting as if they're almost done and out of here. One of them looks up in my direction, as if he heard me, but the others don't, either because they haven't spotted me or because they know I'm there and Oh well, it's just Theodore Freak.<br><br>Then his head turns away from me and he points at the sky. At first I think he's pointing at me, but it's at that moment I see her, the girl. She stands a few feet away on the other side of the tower, also out on the ledge, dark-blond hair waving in the breeze, the hem of her skirt blowing up like a parachute. Even though it's January in Indiana, she is shoeless in tights, a pair of boots in her hand, and staring either at her feet or at the ground--it's hard to tell. She seems frozen in place.<br><br>In my regular, nonpreacher voice I say, as calmly as possible, "Take it from me, the worst thing you can do is look down."<br><br>Very slowly, she turns her head toward me, and I know this girl, or at least I've seen her in the hallways. I can't resist: "Come here often? Because this is kind of my spot and I don't remember seeing you here before."<br><br>She doesn't laugh or blink, just gazes out at me from behind these clunky glasses that almost cover her face. She tries to take a step back and her foot bumps the railing. She teeters a little, and before she can panic, I say, "I don't know what brings you up here, but to me the town looks prettier and the people look nicer and even the worst of them look almost kind. Except for Gabe Romero and Amanda Monk and that whole crowd you hang out with."<br><br>Her name is Violet Something. She is cheerleader popular--one of those girls you would never think of running into on a ledge six stories above the ground. Behind the ugly glasses she's pretty, almost like a china doll. Large eyes, sweet face shaped like a heart, a mouth that wants to curve into a perfect little smile. She's a girl who dates guys like Ryan Cross, baseball star, and sits with Amanda Monk and the other queen bees at lunch.<br><br>"But let's face it, we didn't come up here for the view. You're Violet, right?"<br><br>She blinks once, and I take this as a yes.<br><br>"Theodore Finch. I think we had pre-cal together last year."<br><br>She blinks again.<br><br>"I hate math, but that's not why I'm up here. No offense if that's why you are. You're probably better at math than I am, because pretty much everyone's better at math than I am, but it's okay, I'm fine with it. See, I excel at other, more important things--guitar, sex, and consistently disappointing my dad, to name a few. By the way, it's apparently true that you'll never use it in the real world. Math, I mean."<br><br>I keep talking, but I can tell I'm running out of steam. I need to take a piss, for one thing, and so my words aren't the only thing twitching. (Note to self: Before attempting to take own life, remember to take a leak.) And, two, it's starting to rain, which, in this temperature, will probably turn to sleet before it hits the ground.<br><br>"It's starting to rain," I say, as if she doesn't know this. "I guess there's an argument to be made that the rain will wash away the blood, leaving us a neater mess to clean up than otherwise. But it's the mess part that's got me thinking. I'm not a vain person, but I am human, and I don't know about you, but I don't want to look like I've been run through the wood chipper at my funeral."<br><br>She's shivering or shaking, I can't tell which, and so I slowly inch my way toward her, hoping I don't fall off before I get there, because the last thing I want to do is make a jackass out of myself in front of this girl. "I've made it clear I want cremation, but my mom doesn't believe in it." And my dad will do whatever she says so he won't upset her any more than he already has, and besides, You're far too young to think about this, you know your Grandma Finch lived to be ninety-eight, we don't need to talk about that now, Theodore, don't upset your mother.<br><br>"So it'll be an open coffin for me, which means if I jump, it ain't gonna be pretty. Besides, I kind of like my face intact like this, two eyes, one nose, one mouth, a full set of teeth, which, if I'm being honest, is one of my better features." I smile so she can see what I mean. Everything where it should be, on the outside at least.<br><br>When she doesn't say anything, I go on inching and talking. "Most of all, I feel bad for the undertaker. What a shitty job that must be anyway, but then to have to deal with an asshole like me?"<br><br>From down below, someone yells, "Violet? Is that Violet up there?"<br><br>"Oh God," she says, so low I barely hear it. "OhGodohGodohGod." The wind blows her skirt and hair, and it looks like she's going to fly away.<br><br>There is general buzzing from the ground, and I shout, "Don't try to save me! You'll only kill yourself!" Then I say, very low, just to her, "Here's what I think we should do." I'm about a foot away from her now. "I want you to throw your shoes toward the bell and then hold on to the rail, just grab right onto it, and once you've got it, lean against it and then lift your right foot up and over. Got that?"<br><br>"Okay." She nods and almost loses her balance.<br><br>"Don't nod."<br><br>"Okay."<br><br>"And whatever you do, don't go the wrong way and step forward instead of back. I'll count you off. On three. Okay?"<br><br>"Okay." She throws her boots in the direction of the bell, and they fall with a thud, thud onto the concrete.<br><br>"One. Two. Three."<br><br>She grips the stone and kind of props herself against it and then lifts her leg up and over so that she's sitting on the railing. She stares down at the ground and I can see that she's frozen again, and so I say, "Good. Great. Just stop looking down."<br><br>She slowly looks at me and then reaches for the floor of the bell tower with her right foot, and once she's found it, I say, "Now get that left leg back over however you can. Don't let go of the wall." By now she's shaking so hard I can hear her teeth chatter, but I watch as her left foot joins her right, and she is safe.<br><br>So now it's just me out here. I gaze down at the ground one last time, past my size-thirteen feet that won't stop growing--today I'm wearing sneakers with fluorescent laces--past the open windows of the fourth floor, the third, the second, past Amanda Monk, who is cackling from the front steps and swishing her blond hair like a pony, books over her head, trying to flirt and protect herself from the rain at the same time.<br><br>I gaze past all of this at the ground itself, which is now slick and damp, and imagine myself lying there.<br><br>I could just step off. It would be over in seconds. No more "Theodore Freak." No more hurt. No more anything.<br><br>I try to get past the unexpected interruption of saving a life and return to the business at hand. For a minute, I can feel it: the sense of peace as my mind goes quiet, like I'm already dead. I am weightless and free. Nothing and no one to fear, not even myself.<br><br>Then a voice from behind me says, "I want you to hold on to the rail, and once you've got it, lean against it and lift your right foot up and over."<br><br>Like that, I can feel the moment passing, maybe already passed, and now it seems like a stupid idea, except for picturing the look on Amanda's face as I go sailing by her. I laugh at the thought. I laugh so hard I almost fall off, and this scares me--like, really scares me--and I catch myself and Violet catches me as Amanda looks up. "Weirdo!" someone shouts. Amanda's little group snickers. She cups her big mouth and aims it skyward. "You okay, V?"<br><br>Violet leans over the rail, still holding on to my legs. "I'm okay."<br><br>The door at the top of the tower stairs cracks open and my best friend, Charlie Donahue, appears. Charlie is black. Not CW black, but black-black. He also gets laid more than anyone else I know.<br><br>He says, "They're serving pizza today," as if I wasn't standing on a ledge six stories above the ground, my arms outstretched, a girl wrapped around my knees.<br><br>"Why don't you go ahead and get it over with, freak?" Gabe Romero, better known as Roamer, better known as Dumbass, yells from below. More laughter.<br><br>Because I've got a date with your mother later, I think but don't say because, let's face it, it's lame, and also he will come up here and beat my face in and then throw me off, and this defeats the point of just doing it myself.<br><br>Instead I shout, "Thanks for saving me, Violet. I don't know what I would've done if you hadn't come along. I guess I'd be dead right now."<br><br>The last face I see below belongs to my school counselor, Mr. Embry. As he glares up at me, I think, Great. Just great.<br><br>I let Violet help me over the wall and onto the concrete. From down below, there's a smattering of applause, not for me, but for Violet, the hero. Up close like this, I can see that her skin is smooth and clear except for two freckles on her right cheek, and her eyes are a gray-green that makes me think of fall. It's the eyes that get me. They are large and arresting, as if she sees everything. As warm as they are, they are busy, no-bullshit eyes, the kind that can look right into you, which I can tell even through the glasses. She's pretty and tall, but not too tall, with long, restless legs and curvy hips, which I like on a girl. Too many high school girls are built like boys.<br><br>"I was just sitting there," she says. "On the railing. I didn't come up here to--"<br><br>"Let me ask you something. Do you think there's such a thing as a perfect day?"<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"A perfect day. Start to finish. When nothing terrible or sad or ordinary happens. Do you think it's possible?"<br><br>"I don't know."<br><br>"Have you ever had one?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"I've never had one either, but I'm looking for it."<br><br>She whispers, "Thank you, Theodore Finch." She reaches up and kisses me on the cheek, and I can smell her shampoo, which reminds me of flowers. She says into my ear, "If you ever tell anyone about this, I'll kill you." Carrying her boots, she hurries away and out of the rain, back through the door that leads to the flight of dark and rickety stairs that takes you down to one of the many too-bright and too-crowded school hallways.</p><h2>Kitchens &amp; Baths 1-2-3</h2><p>Packed with Home Depot&#x2019;s expertise and renowned "wisdom of the aisles," this handy resource offers everything the do-it-yourselfer needs to execute the ideal remodeling plan for a kitchen or bath.<p>The ultimate resource for homeowners planning to remodel their kitchens or baths.</p><p>Gives readers design guidance, tips, and expert advice.</p><p>Advice on how to buy materials, appliances, and fixtures.</p><p>Expanded appendix includes step-by-step instructions and illustrations on how to remodel kitchens and baths.</p><p>Shows kitchen and bath designs for all sizes, styles, and budgets.</p><p>Helps remodelers from planning to completion.</p><p>Ideas on financing a project.</p></p><p>This terrific, colorful guide from the experts at Home Depot is perfect for the beginner but is also detailed enough for advanced do-it-yourselfers.

"The Path to Love." Philosophical, inspiring, and ultimately very practical, The Path to Love is a book that can change lives as it invites the spirit to work its wonders on the most complex and richly rewarding terrain of all: the human heart.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>In an era when people are relying on gimmicky rulebooks for snagging a date, it&#39;s refreshing to read a book that reminds us to dip our empty hearts into the wellspring of spirit. Only then will we be able to fill our lives with the love we long to give and receive. Although Deepak Chopra&#39;s message isn&#39;t new, his delivery is eloquent and original. The built-in questions and tests about projection, sexuality, and attachment are as helpful as a weekend couples workshop. Those who aren&#39;t in a relationship, but long to be, are invited to forego the cute tricks to entice a date, and instead ignite the passion of spirit, which naturally draws moths to the flame.Drawing on the Vedic texts of India and other great wisdom traditions, Dr. Chopra describes the seven stages of love, beginning and culminating in ecstasy. At each stage we hear stories like those of Clare, who only falls in love with unattainable men; of Frank and Della, whose eight-year-old marriage has become a battleground of distrust; and of Gail and Jarrett, who near retirement without understanding how they will fit together into their new lives. As we see these couples overcome their obstacles, and as we work through a series of specific exercises, we anchor these lessons in our own experience.</p><h2>Anxious for Nothing: God&#39;s Cure for the Cares of Your Soul (MacArthur Study Series)</h2><p><p>So many things to worry about and so little time to worry!

But how, in day-to-day life, does that really happen?</p> <p>While numerous books have been written on overcoming anxiety, <i>Anxious for Nothing</i> goes beyond pop psychology's temporary cures by returning us to our only true source of comfort and victory: Scripture.</p></p><p>John MacArthur, Jr. is president and featured teacher of Grace To Your, the nonprofit organization responsible for developing, producing, and distributing John&#39;s books, audiocassettes, and the &#34;Grace to You&#34; radio program. &#34;Grace to You&#34; airs more than 800 times daily in locations across America and around the world.

X 1-6<br><br></p><p></p><h2>The Dinner Party: Stories</h2><p><b><b>A <i>New York Times Book Review </i>Notable Book of the Year</b></b><b><b><br>The first collection of short stories from the critically acclaimed, prize-winning author of <i>To Rise Again at a Decent Hour</i>. <br></b></b><br>These eleven stories by Joshua Ferris, many of which were first published in <i>The New Yorker</i>, are at once thrilling, strange, and comic. The modern tribulations of marriage, ambition, and the fear of missing out as the temptations flow like wine and the minutes of life tick down are explored with the characteristic wit and insight that have made Ferris one of our most critically acclaimed novelists. <br><br>Each of these stories burrows deep into the often awkward and hilarious misunderstandings that pass between strangers and lovers alike, and that turn ordinary lives upside down. Ferris shows to what lengths we mortals go to coax human meaning from our very modest time on earth, an effort that skews ever-more desperately in the direction of redemption. There's Arty Groys, the Florida retiree whose birthday celebration involves pizza, a prostitute, and a life-saving heart attack. There's Sarah, the Brooklynite whose shape-shifting existential dilemma is set in motion by a simple spring breeze. And there's Jack, a man so warped by past experience that he's incapable of having a normal social interaction with the man he hires to help him move out of storage. <br><br>The stories in <i>The Dinner Party</i> are about lives changed forever when the reckless gives way to possibility and the ordinary cedes ground to mystery. And each one confirms Ferris's reputation as one of the most dazzlingly talented, deeply humane writers at work today. <br><br></p><p>Joshua Ferris is the bestselling author of three novels, <i>Then We Came to the End</i>, <i>The Unnamed</i> and <i>To Rise Again at a Decent Hour</i>. He has been a finalist for the National Book Award, winner of the Barnes and Noble Discover Award and the PEN/Hemingway Award, short-listed for the Man Booker Prize, winner of the International Dylan Thomas Prize, and was named one of <i>The New Yorker</i>'s "20 Under 40" writers in 2010. He lives in New York. <br>Praise for Joshua Ferris's THE DINNER PARTY:<br><b>A <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book</b><b><i>Washington Post</i> Notable Fiction </b><b>NPR's Best Books of 2017 </b><b><i>The Guardian </i>Best Books of 2017</b><b><i>Esquire</i> Best Books of the Year </b><b><i>The Week</i> Best Books of 2017</b><br><br>"A magnificent black carnival of discord and delusion....For some accomplished novelists--and Ferris is one of the best of our day--short stories are mere doodles, warm ups or warm downs, slight variations on themes better addressed at length. Not so for Ferris. Dynamic with speed, yet rich with novelistic density, his stories make <i>The Dinner Party</i> a full-fledged feast."&#x2015;<b>Will Blythe</b>, <b><i><i>New York Times Book Review</i><br></i></b><br><br>"Plenty of novels, memoirs and cultural studies have explored the end of men or the failings of masculinity. But Ferris, a darkly comic writer who feels like the novelist equivalent of the filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen, has managed to write a series of stories on the subject that feels fresh. His male characters mess up, in small and spectacular fashion, but their misdeeds often prompt our sympathy, thanks to Ferris's insightful narration."&#x2015;<b>Ian Shapira</b>, <b><i><i>The Washington Post</i><br></i></b><br><br>"Ferris finesses the line between tragedy and comedy, and his sly wit often surfaces in sarcastic, offbeat ways...<i>The Dinner Party</i> provides a fine showcase for his work."&#x2015;<b>Heller McAlpin</b>, <b><i>NPR.org</i></b><br><br>"Ferris is an incisive observer, and his descriptions of even the most quotidian situations are elegant and fresh." <br>&#x2015;<b>Eliot Schrefer</b>, <b><i><i>USA Today</i><br></i></b><br><br>"Everything comes mordantly alive in the priceless imagination of Ferris....His perverse short narratives do not disappoint."&#x2015;<b>Janet Maslin</b>, <b><i><i>New York Times</i>, Books to Breeze Through This Summer<br></i></b><br><br>"Observational and piercing, Ferris's short stories expose how fraught and emotionally explosive the search for connection with other human beings can be."&#x2015;<b>Angela Ledgerwood</b>, <b><i><i>Esquire</i>, 20 Best Books of 2017 (so far)<br></i></b><br><br>"<i>The Dinner Party</i> is a collection of stories about quiet, domestic chaos...

After his retirement from the saddle in 1957, he published an autobiography, <i>The Sport of Queens</i>, before going on to write more than forty acclaimed books, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Even Money</i> and <i>Silks</i>.</p> <p>A three-time Edgar Award winner, he also received the prestigious Crime Writers&#x2019; Association&#x2019;s Cartier Diamond Dagger, was named Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America, and was awarded a CBE in the Queen&#x2019;s Birthday Honours List in 2000.

West at Brigham Youn University.</p><p></p><h2>E. E. Cummings: A Life</h2><p><p>From the author of <i>American Bloomsbury, Louisa May Alcott</i>, and <i>Home Before Dark</i>, a major reassessment of the life and work of the novelist, painter, and playwright considered to be one of America&#x2019;s preeminent twentieth-century poets. At the time of his death in 1962, at age sixty-eight, he was, after Robert Frost, the most widely read poet in the United States.<br>&nbsp;<br>E. E. Cummings was and remains controversial. He has been called &#x201c;a master&#x201d; (Malcolm Cowley); &#x201c;hideous&#x201d; (Edmund Wilson). James Dickey called him a &#x201c;daringly original poet with more vitality and more sheer uncompromising talent than any other living American writer.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>In Susan Cheever&#x2019;s rich, illuminating biography we see Cummings&#x2019;s idyllic childhood years in Cambridge, Massachusetts; his Calvinist father&#x2014;distinguished Harvard professor and sternly religious minister of the Cambridge Congregational Church; his mother&#x2014;loving, attentive, a source of encouragement, the aristocrat of the family, from Unitarian writers, judges, and adventurers. <br>&nbsp;<br>We see Cummings&#x2014;slight, agile, playful, a product of a nineteenth-century New England childhood, bred to be flinty and determined; his love of nature; his sense of fun, laughter, mimicry; his desire from the get-go to stand conventional wisdom on its head, which he himself would often do, literally, to amuse. <br>&nbsp;<br>At Harvard, he roomed with John Dos Passos; befriended Lincoln Kirstein; read Latin, Greek, and French; earned two degrees; discovered alcohol, fast cars, and burlesque at the Old Howard Theater; and raged against the school&#x2019;s conservative, exclusionary upper-class rule by A. Lawrence Lowell. <br>&nbsp;<br>In Cheever&#x2019;s book we see that beneath Cummings&#x2019;s blissful, golden childhood the strains of sadness and rage were already at play. He grew into a dark young man and set out on a lifelong course of rebellion against conventional authority and the critical establishment, devouring the poetry of Ezra Pound, whose radical verses pushed Cummings away from the politeness of the traditional nature poem toward a more adventurous, sexually conscious form.<br>&nbsp;<br>We see that Cummings&#x2019;s self-imposed exile from Cambridge&#x2014;a town he&#x2019;d come to hate for its intellectualism, Puritan uptightness, racism, and self-righteous xenophobia&#x2014;seemed necessary for him as a man and a poet. Headstrong and cavalier, he volunteered as an ambulance driver in World War I, working alongside Hemingway, Joyce, and Ford Madox Ford . . . his ongoing stand against the imprisonment of his soul taking a literal turn when he was held in a makeshift prison for &#x201c;undesirables and spies,&#x201d; an experience that became the basis for his novel, <i>The Enormous Room</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>We follow Cummings as he permanently flees to Greenwich Village to be among other modernist poets of the day&#x2014;Marianne Moore, Hart Crane, Dylan Thomas&#x2014;and we see the development of both the poet and his work against the backdrop of modernism and through the influences of his contemporaries: Stein, Amy Lowell, Joyce, and Pound. Cheever&#x2019;s fascinating book gives us the evolution of an artist whose writing was at the forefront of what was new and daring and bold in an America in transition.<br><br>(With 28 pages of black-and-white images.)</p></p><p><p><b>Susan Cheever </b>was born in New York City and graduated from Brown University.

She lives in New York City.</p><p><b><i>Preface</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br><i>A Visit to the Masters School</i><br>&nbsp;<br>During the last years of his life E. E. Cummings made a modest living on the high-school lecture circuit. In the winter of 1960 his schedule brought him to read his adventurous poems at an uptight girls&#x2019; school in Westchester where I was a miserable seventeen-year-old junior with failing grades.<br>&nbsp;<br>I vaguely knew that Cummings had been a friend of my father&#x2019;s; my father loved to tell stories about Cummings&#x2019;s gallantry, and Cummings&#x2019;s ability to live elegantly on almost no money&#x2014;an ability my father himself struggled to cultivate. When my father was a young writer in New York City, in the golden days before marriage and children pressured him to move to the suburbs, the older Cummings had been his beloved friend and adviser.<br>&nbsp;<br>On that cold night in 1960, Cummings was near the end of his brilliant and controversial forty-year career as this country&#x2019;s only true modernist poet. Primarily remembered these days for its funky punctuation, Cummings&#x2019;s work was in fact a wildly ambitious attempt at creating a new way of seeing the world through language. Part of a powerful group of writers and artists, many of whom were Cummings&#x2019;s friends&#x2014;James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Hart Crane, Marianne Moore, Ezra Pound, Marcel Duchamp, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse&#x2014;he struggled to reshape the triangle between the reader, the writer, and the subject of the poem, novel, or painting. As early as his 1915 Harvard College graduation valedictorian speech, Cummings told his audience that &#x201c;the New Art, maligned though it may be by fakirs and fanatics, will appear in its essential spirit . . . as a courageous and genuine exploration of untrodden ways.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Modernism as Cummings and his mid-twentieth-century colleagues embraced it had three parts. The first was the exploration of using sounds instead of meanings to connect words to the reader&#x2019;s feelings. The second was the idea of stripping away all unnecessary things to bring attention to form and structure: the formerly hidden skeleton of a work would now be exuberantly visible. The third facet of modernism was an embrace of adversity. In a world seduced by easy understanding, the modernists believed that difficulty enhanced the pleasures of reading. In a Cummings poem the reader must often pick his way toward comprehension, which comes, when it does, in a burst of delight and recognition. Like many of his fellow modernists (there were those who walked out of Stravinsky&#x2019;s Rite of Spring, and viewers were scandalized by Marcel Duchamp&#x2019;s Nude Descending a Staircase), Cummings was sometimes reviled by the fakirs and fanatics of the critical establishment. Princeton poet Richard P. Blackmur said Cummings&#x2019;s poems were &#x201c;baby talk,&#x201d; and poetry arbiter Helen Vendler called them repellent and foolish: &#x201c;What is wrong with a man who writes this?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nothing was wrong with Cummings&#x2014;or Duchamp or Stravinsky or Joyce, for that matter. All were trying to slow down the seemingly inexorable rush of the world, to force people to notice their own lives. In the twenty-first century, that rush has now reached Force Five; we are all inundated with information and given no time to wonder what it means or where it came from. Access without understanding and facts without context have become our daily diet.<br>&nbsp;<br>Although in the 1950s and &#x2019;60s Cummings was one of the most popular poets in America, he sometimes didn&#x2019;t make enough money to pay the rent on the ramshackle apartment in Greenwich Village on Patchin Place where he lived with the incandescently beautiful model Marion Morehouse. This bothered Cummings not at all. He was delighted by almost everything in life except for the institutions and formal rules that he believed sought to deaden feelings. &#x201c;Guilt is the cause of more disauders / than history&#x2019;s most obscene marorders,&#x201d; Cummings wrote.<br>&nbsp;<br>Cummings was an American aristocrat with two degrees from Harvard; my father had been headed for Harvard when he was expelled from high school, and he adored Cummings&#x2019;s combination of academic success and lighthearted lack of reverence for academic success. In spite of his establishment background, Cummings treated the establishment with an amused contempt.<br>&nbsp;<br>At a time when The New Yorker annoyingly bowdlerized my father&#x2019;s mentions of kissing, Cummings got away with writing graphic erotic poetry, neatly stepping around the Mrs. Grundys of the magazine world. &#x201c;may i feel said he / (i&#x2019;ll squeal said she / just once said he),&#x201d; he wrote, in a famous poem that doesn&#x2019;t upset the apple cart as much as give it a new team of wild horses. He also wrote some of the sweetest love poems of the century:<br>&nbsp;<br>i carry your heart with me(i carry it in<br>my heart)i am never without it(anywhere<br>i go you go,my dear; and whatever is done<br>by only me is your doing,my darling)<br>&nbsp;<br>My father drove me to school that night&#x2014;the Masters School, in Dobbs Ferry, was thirty minutes from where we lived in Scarborough. As we stepped into the entrance hall, Cummings bellowed &#x201c;JOEY!&#x201d;&#x2014;my father&#x2019;s boyhood nickname. The two men heartily embraced as the school&#x2019;s sour founders and headmistresses glared down from their gold-framed portraits on the paneled walls.<br>&nbsp;<br>Cummings was taller than my father and eighteen years older, but they both wore tattered Harris Tweed jackets. Cummings had developed an electrifying and acrobatic way to give poetry readings, sitting on a chair and moving around the stage instead of hiding behind a lectern, and timing his readings to the second. For this audience, he knew enough to skip his erotic masterpieces. His elegance and courtesy got him a standing ovation, especially for a powerful, moving evocation of his father: &#x201c;my father moved through dooms of love / through sames of am through haves of give, / singing each morning out of each night&nbsp;. . .&#x201d; After an encore, he appeared in his coat and scarf to let the audience know he had to go home.<br>&nbsp;<br>My father and I drove him home to Patchin Place. &#x201c;He was the most brilliant monologist I have ever known,&#x201d; wrote Malcolm Cowley; and that night, leaning forward from the backseat of our secondhand Dodge, I was treated to what Archibald MacLeish called one of Cummings&#x2019;s &#x201c;virtuoso performances.&#x201d; Cummings was an unabashed and very funny rebel; he also had an astonishingly mobile face and a flexible dancer&#x2019;s body. He wasn&#x2019;t just an inspired mimic; he seemed to become the people he was imitating. To this day my ninety-four-year-old mother fondly remembers his imitations, his collapsible top hat, and his willingness to stand on his head for a laugh.<br>&nbsp;<br>As we turned out of the school&#x2019;s genteel, tree-lined driveway and down the hill to Route 9, headed for the vibrant city, Cummings let out a deep, comic sigh of relief. My father drove, and Cummings talked, mocking the teachers who were making my life miserable&#x2014;he said the place was more like a prison than a school. It was a hatchery whose goal was to produce uniformity. I was unhappy there? No wonder! I was a spirited and wise young woman. Only a mindless moron (Cummings loved alliteration) could excel in a place like that. What living soul could even survive a week in that assembly line for obedient girls, that pedagogical factory whose only purpose was to turn out so-called educated wives for upper-class blowhards with red faces and swollen bank balances? I had been told not to be so negative all the time. Cummings reminded me of his friend Marianne Moore&#x2019;s admonition: you mustn&#x2019;t be so open-minded that your brains fall out.<br>&nbsp;<br>When we stopped for burgers at a White Castle in the Bronx, heads turned at Cummings&#x2019;s uncanny, hilarious imitation of the head of the Masters School English Department. In that well-lighted place, late at night, my father produced a flask and spiked the coffee. I was already drunk on a different kind of substance&#x2014;inspiration. It wasn&#x2019;t those in authority who were always right; it was the opposite. I saw that being right was a petty goal&#x2014;being free was the thing to aim for. My father, who had always sided with the school, listened. Within a year he had consented to send me to a different kind of school, an alternative school in South Woodstock, Vermont, where I was very happy.<br>&nbsp;<br>History has given us very few heretics who have not been burned at the stake. Cummings was our generation&#x2019;s beloved heretic, a Henry David Thoreau for the twentieth century. He lived most of his life in Greenwich Village, at Patchin Place, during a time when experiments of all kinds, social, artistic, and literary, were being carried out. He knew everyone in the city&#x2019;s downtown hobohemia, from the iconic homeless Harvard alumnus Joe Gould, whose oral history was more myth than reality, to the sculptor Gaston Lachaise. In his almost three thousand poems he sometimes furiously, sometimes lovingly debunked anything or anyone in power&#x2014;even death, in his famous poem about Buffalo Bill, with its spangled alliterations and intimate last lines: &#x201c;and what i want to know is / how do you like your blueeyed boy / Mister Death.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Cummings despised fear, and his life was lived in defiance of all who ruled by it. This led him into some political carelessness. After a miserable stint trying to write screenplays in Hollywood, he wrote some stupidly anti-Semitic poems and sentences. His feelings about communism led him to become a fan of Senator Joseph McCarthy. On the other hand, when it came to writing about love and sex, Cummings did for poetry what Henry Miller was doing for prose.<br>&nbsp;<br>Even more shocking, he was no respecter of social mores. &#x201c;but it&#x2019;s life said he / but your wife said she / now said he) / ow said she / (tiptop said he / don&#x2019;t stop said she / oh no said he) / go slow said she&nbsp;. . .&#x201d; Instead of using dialect as novelists do today, he explored phonetics in a way that urges the reader to speak the dialect in question: &#x201c;oil tel duh woil doi sez, dooyuh unners tanmih.&#x201d; In a world where his antithesis Robert Frost was famously opining that free verse was like playing tennis without a net, Cummings&#x2014;who, unlike Frost, had a rigorous classical education&#x2014;showed that traditions like the sonnet form could be reinvented.<br>&nbsp;<br>Cummings and my father met in New York City in the 1930s, introduced by the biographer Morris Werner; his wife, Hazel Hawthorne Werner; and Malcolm Cowley. (Malcolm was later my father-in-law, but that&#x2019;s another story.) &#x201c;His hair was nearly gone,&#x201d; my father recalled of their first meetings, with the kind of exaggerated black humor both men loved; &#x201c;his last book of poetry had been rejected by every estimable publisher, his wife was six months pregnant by her dentist and his Aunt Jane had purloined his income and had sent him, by way of compensation, a carton of Melba toast.&#x201d; Cummings&#x2019;s second wife was leaving him, and he was having trouble finding a publisher. Yet he urged my father to be proud. &#x201c;A writer is a Prince!&#x201d; he insisted. He also, with more success, urged him to abandon Boston, &#x201c;a city without springboards for people who can&#x2019;t dive.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>By the time I heard him read at the Masters School that night in 1960, I was steeped in Cummings stories that few people had heard. My father&#x2019;s credo was taken from a letter Cummings had written to cheer him when my father was an infantry sergeant in the Philippines in 1942. &#x201c;I too have slept with someone&#x2019;s boot in the corner of my smile,&#x201d; my father often quoted, although he cleaned up Cummings&#x2019;s experimental language. &#x201c;listen, moi aussi have slept in mmuudd with a kumrad&#x2019;s feet in the corners of my smile,&#x201d; Cummings actually wrote. The letter included an autumn leaf and a ten-dollar bill. I have it on my wall today.<br>&nbsp;<br>In another favorite story of my father&#x2019;s, Cummings and Marion, literally penniless, used their last two tokens to take the subway uptown from Patchin Place to a fabulous New Year&#x2019;s Eve party. They were dressed to the nines: she, long-legged in a spectacular evening gown, and he in a glamorous gentleman&#x2019;s top hat and tails. The night was freezing cold; how would they get home? Neither of them worried at all as they dazzled the partygoers and had the time of their lives.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the elevator on their way home in the early morning, the airy, beautiful couple noticed a leaden banker and his stodgy wife. They were all a little drunk on champagne. The banker admired Cummings&#x2019;s beautiful hat. &#x201c;Sir,&#x201d; asked Cummings in his educated accent, &#x201c;what would you give for the privilege of stepping on it?&#x201d; The banker paid ten dollars, the hat collapsed on cue, and Cummings and Marion took a cab back to Patchin Place.<br>&nbsp;<br>The way he died, in 1962, at Joy Farm, the Cummings family place in Silver Lake, New Hampshire, was another one of my father&#x2019;s often-told stories. Marion had called him in to dinner as day faded and the glorious sky lit up with the fires of sunset. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there in a moment,&#x201d; Cummings said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just going to sharpen the axe.&#x201d; A few minutes later he crumpled to the ground, felled by a cerebral hemorrhage. He was sixty-seven. That, my father let us all know, was the way to die&#x2014;still manly and useful, still beloved, still strong. &#x201c; &#x2018;how do you like your blueeyed boy / Mister Death,&#x2019; &#x201d; my father growled, his eyes wet with tears.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fortunately, almost miraculously, Patchin Place is a corner of New York City that has been virtually untouched by the last fifty years. Still a small mews of shabby houses tucked off a tree-lined street in the West Village, it is home to a bohemian group of writers, eccentrics, and people who have lived there for decades. In the summer, through the open windows, you can see a woman reading in a room piled high with books. A gray tabby snoozes in the sun on the pavement. In the spring there are homemade window boxes and piles of literary junk from spring cleanings, and in the winter the snow falls softly on the peeling paint of white fences and sagging iron gates between the mews and Tenth Street. Two plaques are bolted to number 4, where Cummings rented a studio in the back on the third floor, and later a ground-floor apartment with Marion.<br>&nbsp;<br>You step away from the traffic and trendiness of lattes and expensive baby clothes on Sixth Avenue and into a place where time stands still. When I wander there under the streetlights on warm evenings, it could be the night fifty years ago that my father and I drove Cummings home. When we got to Patchin Place that night, Cummings warmly invited us to come in for more conversation. We could talk awhile, have a coffee, and listen to some of his new poems; but it was late, and we had a long drive home. Now, in this book, I would like to take him up on that invitation.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>New York City</i><br><i>June 2012</i></p></p><h2>Miracle Cures: Dramatic New Scientific Discoveries Revealing the Healing Powers of Herbs, Vitamins, and Other Natural Remedies</h2><p>Nationally syndicated columnist and America's leading authority on health and nutrition, Jean Carper now turns her attention to the public's increasing demand for medically proven natural cures.

All of the compounds and alternative treatments listed in <i>Miracle Cures</i> are regularly practiced in Europe, Asia, or both. So why aren't they used in the United States? Carper points out that since "nature owns the patent," there's little financial incentive for American pharmaceutical companies to investigate natural compounds. Secondly, most American doctors are simply unaware of the testing that has been done on these techniques; most research has been done by non-English speaking physicians and written up in foreign journals.

Now, in this haunting new work, Pï¿½rez-Reverte has written his most accomplished novel to date. <i>The Painter of Battles </i>is a captivating tale of love, war, art, and revenge.<br><br>Andrï¿½s Faulques, a world-renowned war photographer, has retired to a life of solitude on the Spanish coast. On the walls of a tower overlooking the sea, he spends his days painting a huge mural that pays homage to history&#x2019;s classic works of war art and that incorporates a lifetime of disturbing images. <br>One night, an unexpected visitor arrives at Faulques&#x2019; door and challenges the painter to remember him. As Faulques struggles to recall the face, the man explains that he was the subject of an iconic photo taken by Faulques in a war zone years ago. &#x201c;And why have you come looking for me?&#x201d; asks Faulques. The stranger answers, &#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m going to kill you.&#x201d;<br><br>This story transports Faulques to the time when he crossed continents to capture conflicts on film with his lover, Olvido, at his side.

What they are grappling with quickly proves to be not just Faulques&#x2019; fate but the very nature of human love and cruelty itself.<br><br>Arturo Pï¿½rez-Reverte perfectly balances the shadows of the heart with the chaos of war in this stunning composition on morality. Superb and tautly written, <i>The Painter of Battles </i>is a deeply affecting novel about life and art.</p><p>Arturo Pï¿½rez-Reverte&#x2019;s bestselling books, including <i>The Club Dumas, The Flanders Panel, The Seville Communion,</i> and the Captain Alatriste series, have been translated into thirty-four languages in fifty countries and have sold millions of copies. Pï¿½rez-Reverte was born in 1951 in Cartagena, Spain, and now lives in Madrid, where he was recently elected to the Spanish Royal Academy. A retired war journalist, he covered conflicts in Angola, Bosnia, Croatia, El Salvador, Lebanon, Libya, Nicaragua, Romania, the Persian Gulf, and Sudan, among others. He now writes fiction full-time.1.<br><br>He swam one hundred and fifty strokes out to sea and the same number back, as he did each morning, until he felt the round pebbles of the shore beneath his feet. He dried himself, using the towel he&#x2019;d hung on a tree trunk that had been swept in by the sea, put on his shirt and sneakers, and went up the narrow path leading from the cove to the watchtower. There he made coffee and began, mixing blues and grays that would lend his work the proper atmosphere. During the night&#x2014;each night he slept less and less, and that only a restless dozing&#x2014;he had decided that cold tones would be needed to delineate the melancholy line of the horizon, where a veiled light outlined the silhouettes of warriors walking beside the sea. Those tones would envelop them in reflections from the waves washing onto the beach that he had spent four days creating with light touches of Titian white, applied pure. So in a glass jar he mixed white, blue, and a minimal amount of natural sienna, until they were transformed into a luminous blue. Then he daubed some of the paint on the oven tray he used as a palette, dirtied the mixture with a little yellow, and worked without stopping the rest of the morning. Finally he clamped the handle of the brush between his teeth and stepped back to judge the effect. Sky and sea were now harmoniously combined in the mural that circled the interior of the tower, and although there was still a lot to be done, the horizon was now a smooth, slightly hazy line that accentuated the loneliness of the men&#x2014;dark strokes splashed with metallic sparks&#x2014;dispersed and moving away beneath the rain.<br><br>He rinsed the brushes with soap and water and set them to dry. From the foot of the cliff below came the sound of the motors and music of the tourist boat that ran along the coast every day at the same hour. With no need to look, Andrï¿½s Faulques knew that it was one o&#x2019;clock. He heard the usual woman&#x2019;s voice, amplified by the loudspeaker system, and it seemed even stronger and clearer when the boat drew even with the inlet, for then the sound reached the tower with no obstacle other than the few pines and bushes that despite erosion and slides were still clinging to the cliff face.<br><br>This place is known as Cala del Arrï¿½ez. It was once the refuge of Berber pirates. Up there on the top of the cliff you can see an old watchtower that was constructed at the beginning of the eighteenth century as a part of the coastal defense, with the specific purpose of warning nearby villages of Saracen incursions . . . <br><br>It was the same voice every day: educated, with good diction. Faulques imagined the woman to be young; no doubt a local guide who accompanied the tourists on the three-hour tour the boat&#x2014;a sixty-five-foot tender painted blue and white that docked in Puerto Umbrï¿½a&#x2014;made between Ahorcados Island and Cabo Malo. In the last two months, from atop the cliff, Faulques had watched it pass, its deck filled with people armed with film and video cameras as summertime music thundered over the loudspeakers, so loud that the interruptions of the woman&#x2019;s voice came as a relief.<br><br>A well-known painter lives in that tower, which stood abandoned for a long time, and he is embellishing the entire interior wall with a large mural. Unfortunately, it is private property and no visitors are allowed . . . <br><br>This time the woman was speaking Spanish, but on other occasions it might be English, Italian, or German. Only when the tickets were bought with francs&#x2014;four or five times that summer&#x2014;did a masculine voice relieve her, in French. At any rate, Faulques thought, the season was almost over; with every trip there were fewer tourists on board the tender, and soon those daily visits would become weekly, until they were interrupted by the harsh gray mistrals that blew in the winter, funneling in through the straits called Bocas de Poniente, darkening sea and sky.<br><br>He turned his attention back to the painting, where new cracks had appeared. The large circular panorama was not as yet continuous; some zones were blank except for strokes of charcoal, simple black lines sketched on the white primer of the wall. The whole formed an immense and disquieting landscape, no title, no specific time, where the shield half buried in the sand, the medieval helmet splashed with blood, the shadow of an assault rifle falling over a forest of wood crosses, the ancient walled city and modern concrete-and-glass towers coexisted less as anachronisms than as evidence.<br><br>Faulques went back to his painting, laboriously, patiently. Although the technical execution was correct, it was not an outstanding work, and he knew it. He had a good hand for drawing, but he was a mediocre painter. He knew that as well. In truth, he had always known it; however, the mural was not destined to be seen by anyone but him. That had little to do with artistic ability and much to do with his memory. With an eye guided by thirty years of hearing the sound of a camera shutter. Hence the framing&#x2014;that was as good a name to give it as any other&#x2014;of all those straight lines and angles traced with a singular, vaguely Cubist severity that lent beings and objects contours as impossible to breach as barbed wire or moats. The mural took up the wall of the ground floor of the watchtower in a continuous panorama twenty-five meters in circumference and almost three meters in height, interrupted only by the openings of two narrow, facing windows, the door that led outside, and the spiral staircase that led to the upper floor that Faulques had arranged as his living quarters: a gas ring, a small refrigerator, a canvas cot, a table and chairs, a rug, and a trunk. He had lived there for seven months, and had spent the first two making it habitable: a temporary waterproof wood roof for the tower, concrete beams to reinforce the walls, shutters at the windows, and the drain that emptied out over the cliff from the small lower-level latrine carved out of the rock. He also had an outdoor water tank installed atop a board-and-tile shed that served both as a shower and as a garage for the motorcycle he rode down to the village each week to buy food.<br><br>The cracks worried Faulques. Too soon, he told himself. And too many. They would not actually affect the future of his work&#x2014;it was a work without a future from the minute he discovered the abandoned tower and conceived his plan&#x2014;only the time he needed to execute it. With that in mind, he nervously passed the tips of his fingers over the crazing that fanned out across the part of the mural that was closest to being finished, over the black and red strokes that represented the asymmetrical, polyhedral backlighting of the walls of the ancient city burning in the distance&#x2014;Bosch, Goya, and Dr. Atl, among others: the hand of man, nature, and destiny fused in the magma of a single horizon. There would be more cracks. These weren&#x2019;t the first. The structural reinforcing of the tower, the plastering, the white acrylic primer, were not enough to counteract the deterioration of the three-hundred-year-old building, the damage that had been caused by harsh weather, erosion, and salt from the nearby sea while it was abandoned. It was also, in a certain way, a struggle against time; its tranquil passing could not disguise its inexorable victory. Although not even that, Faulques concluded with a familiar professional fatalism&#x2014;he&#x2019;d seen a few cracks in his lifetime&#x2014;was of major importance.<br><br>The pain&#x2014;a sharp stab in his side over his right hip&#x2014;arrived every eight or ten hours with reliable punctuality, faithful to their tryst, though this time it came with no warning. Faulques held his breath and didn&#x2019;t move, to allow time for the first whiplash of pain to end; then he picked up a jar from the table and swallowed two tablets with a sip of water. In recent weeks he&#x2019;d had to double the dose. After a moment, calmer now&#x2014;it was worse when the pain came at night, and although it was eased by the tablets, it kept him awake till dawn&#x2014;he reviewed the panorama with a slow look around the entire circle: the distant, modern city and the other city, closer and in flames, the abject silhouettes fleeing from it, the somber, foreshortened, armed men in the foreground, the reddish reflection of the fire&#x2014;fine brushstrokes, vermilion over yellow&#x2014;sliding along the metal of their guns, with the peculiar brilliance that catches the eye of an unfortunate protagonist, uneasy the minute the door opens&#x2014;cloc, cloc, cloc&#x2014;the nightly sound of boots, iron, and guns, precise as a musical score, before they make him come outside, barefoot, and cut off&#x2014;in the updated version, lop off&#x2014;his head. Faulques&#x2019; idea was to extend the light of the burning city as far as the gray dawn of the beach, where the rainy landscape and the sea in the background were fading into an eternal twilight, a prelude to that same night, or another identical to it, an interminable helix that brought the point of the wheel, the swinging pendulum of history, to the top of the arc, again and again, and sent it back the other way.<br><br>A well-known painter, the voice had announced. She always used the same words, while Faulques, imagining the tourists aiming their cameras toward the tower, wondered where the woman&#x2014;the man who spoke in French never mentioned the tower&#x2019;s resident&#x2014;had acquired such inexact information. Maybe, he concluded, it was merely a way of adding more interest to the tour. If Faulques was known in certain places and professional circles, it was not for his painting. After a few youthful cracks at it, and for the rest of his professional life, drawing and brushes had been set aside, far&#x2014;at least so he had thought until only recently&#x2014;from the situations, landscapes, and people recorded through the viewfinder of his camera: the stuff of the world of colors, sensations, and faces that constituted his search for the definitive image; the both fleeting and eternal moment that would...</p><h2>Tularosa: Last of the Frontier West</h2><p><p>Tularosa--sun-scorched, sandblasted, merciless--the parched desert where everything, from cactus to cowman, carries a weapon of some sort, and the only creatures who sleep with both eyes closed are dead.

It's less the fiction that rivets the attention here than the rich lode of historical detail, much of it used to support the view that America shares the blame for the war and that the Japanese military hierarchy received less than fair treatment in being judged by exclusively Western standards. The principal fictional characters are Professor McGlynn, special adviser to the new shogun, MacArthur (and eloquent mouthpiece for Toland's thoughts on the Japanese), and his four children: Floss, married to a Toda; Will, a lawyer for the prosecution at the trials; Mark, an ex-Marine; and Maggie, a journalist. Of the court dramas, all well done, the most stirring are those involving the trial and conviction of General Tojo, head of Japan's wartime government, who comes across as honorable and dignified, if feudal-minded. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.The reviewer of Gods of War ( LJ 4/1/85) commented that the book was "often more like history than fiction." The same is true of the sequel, which offers an almost exhaustive examination of events during the Tokyo war crimes trials. Members of the Toda and McGlynn familes are the main characters in this novel, which begins very shortly after the end of the previous novel in 1945 and describes experiences of both Japanese and Americans in postwar Japan until early 1950. The interaction of attorney's, clients, friends, and relatives serves to illustrate the cultural differences. Especially noteworthy are the explanations for the causes of Pearl Harbor from the Japanese perspective. The true focus is on the trials themselves. Lawyers will find the legal arguments provocative, but the emotional response the first book prompted is lacking here.

One partner will complain that the other doesn&#39;t desire him, the other complains that she&#39;s married to a sex maniac. During his 30 years in practice as a marriage and family therapist, Dr. Schnarch has discovered that sexual desire problems are normal and even healthy, in committed relationships.In Intimacy and Desire: Awaken the Passion in Your Relationship, Dr. Schnarch explains why couples in long term relationships have sexual desire problems, regardless of how much they love each other or how well they communicate. Through case studies of couples he worked with, Dr. Schnarch shows why normal marital conflict can be the cause of desire problems and creates a roadmap for how couples can transform marital conflict into a stronger relationship and a font of new and powerful desire for each other. He takes it a step further, giving readers simple but effective exercises that will help them reconnect with each other.</p><p><p>David Schnarch is a licensed clinical psychologist and author of numerous books and articles on intimacy, sexuality and relationships. His clinical abilities attract clients and students from across the globe. Dr. Schnarch lives and works with his wife, Dr. Ruth Morehouse, in Colorado.</p>Starred Review. Readers sick of typical glossy-magazine self-help patter about reigniting romance, or the droning pomposity of most author-experts, will be pleasantly surprised with psychologist and sex therapist Schnarch (Passionate Marriage). He immediately catches readers&#39; attention by agreeing that the common &#34;just do it&#34; approach to solving sexual problems is not only ineffective, but often results in one partner responding with a decisive &#34;Don&#39;t tell me what to do!&#34; That kind of understanding produces a number of unexpected bombshells-including &#34;Marriage does kill desire&#34;-which produce an uncanny effect: getting couples to stop and reconsider their emotions, quit blaming each other, and start to think (and act) differently regarding sexual situations, behaviors and attitudes. The book&#39;s flaws are more aggravating than genuinely problematic-a tendency to lean on jargon and trademark key phrases (&#34;Four Points of Balance(tm)&#34;)-but O&#39;Neill breaks down complex issues with loosely-drawn real life examples, illustrating the dramatic and fundamental changes that occur when couples have a greater understanding of desire, monogamy and the brain. The process is neither easy nor quick, but Schnarch&#39;s confidence is contagious.</p><h2>Grey Hunter (Space Wolf Series / Warhammer 40,000)</h2><p>The third book in the Space Wolf series.

Debbie shows readers how choosing a word to focus&#x2014;and act&#x2014;on changed not only Debbie, but those around her. In the tradition of <i>One Simple Act</i> and <i>God&#x2019;s Guest List</i>, Debbie tells inspiring stories of how living just one word can change someone&#x2019;s world. In a world where too many meaningless words overwhelm us, the simplicity of one perfect word becomes profound. Words like &#x201c;surrender,&#x201d; &#x201c;believe,&#x201d; and &#x201c;purpose&#x201d; took on new meaning for Debbie when she tried to live them out. <br> <br> Read how Debbie discovered that the word she chose often foreshadowed the crisis she would face in a particular year. For example, the year she chose the word &#x201c;balance,&#x201d; her career moved to a whole new level. The pressures on Debbie to be speaking, promoting, and practically living on the road were overwhelming. It was her yearlong focus on that all-too-difficult word <i>balance</i>, and a plea from a lonely granddaughter, that helped her refine her schedule. Readers will be encouraged to find their word for themselves, and see how one perfect word can make all the difference.</p><p>Debbie Macomber, with more than 100 million copies of her books sold worldwide, is one of today&#x2019;s most popular authors.

In my office I have a number of author autographs lining the wall of my stairwell. Mark Twain. Harper Lee. Charles Dickens. Ernest Hemingway. Harriet Beecher Stowe. These writers are my mentors. As a young woman I read and cherished their stories. They remind me of my responsibility as a writer of fiction and most recently in my venture into the world of nonfiction. Indeed there is tremendous power in words.<br> <br>Pearl S. Buck&#x2019;s novel <i>The Good Earth</i> actually changed foreign policy between the United States and China.

Yes, words have tremendous power. So much meaning can be packed into a word.<br> <br>In the book <i>Simple Little Words: What You Say Can Change a Life</i>, Dr. Dennis Hensley tells the story of how one perfect word changed a life.<br> <br>&nbsp;<br><br>In my capacity as a professor of English at Taylor University Fort Wayne, I teach a survey course in world literature that students of all majors are assigned to take as part of their liberal-arts requirements.<br> <br>A few years ago, I met Sean, a junior and wrestling-squad member who was majoring in elementary education. Sean had a shaved bullet head, legs like fire hydrants, a back that could put Atlas to shame, and biceps that looked like the drawing on boxes of Arm &amp; Hammer Baking Soda. This guy was tough.<br> <br>Sean enjoyed sports, and he excelled at weightlifting and track-and-field events such as discus and hammer throwing. However, he wasn&#x2019;t overly keen on literature. I knew quickly I&#x2019;d have my work cut out in making him an admirer of Keats, Shakespeare, Dante, and Melville.<br> <br>I modified Sean&#x2019;s reading list for that semester to include high-seas adventures by Jack London, mysteries by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and military works by Rudyard Kipling. We met in my office once each week to discuss the books and short stories, and I constantly praised Sean&#x2019;s ability to recognize symbolism, foreshadowing, flashbacks, and other elements of literary expressions that I had lectured about in class.<br> <br>As the semester advanced, so did Sean&#x2019;s grades. He had started as a C student, then rose to the B level. As I showed the class how the applications of literary analysis could help them better appreciate plays and movies, they all became more and more eager to get to class each day. Sean started sitting in the front row, taking copious notes, and I continued to compliment him on his diligence and studiousness.<br> <br>Then, one day, as I was grading papers, I was delighted to be able to give a perfect A to Sean on one of his quizzes over a new short story I&#x2019;d had the students read for that week. At the end of the quiz I wrote, &#x201c;This is superb work, son. I congratulate you. You&#x2019;ve been working hard, and this is the payoff. Well done!&#x201d;<br> <br>I passed the papers back, and I watched as Sean&#x2019;s face lit up in a grin when he saw the huge red A atop his quiz. However, when he turned the page over and read my personal note to him, his countenance changed entirely. He lowered his face, avoided eye contact with me the entire rest of the class, and left just as soon as the bell rang. I was thoroughly confused by such behavior until two days later.<br> <br>During office hours, I glanced up to Sean&#x2019;s hulking frame taking up my entire doorway. &#x201c;Can I come in for a moment, Dr. Hensley?&#x201d; he asked me. I motioned him toward a chair, and he closed the door behind him. I could see that he had his quiz in his hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sir,&#x201d; he began, but then stopped. He lowered his head, and suddenly I realized that this giant of a man was actually weeping. I was stunned. I gave him a moment to collect himself. &#x201c;Sir, you don&#x2019;t know my background.&#x201d;<br> <br>I said nothing as Sean fished a handkerchief from his back pocket and wiped his eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;My dad left my mom and me when I was only seven,&#x201d; Sean said in a low voice. &#x201c;I somehow felt it was my fault that he left. I got it into my head that if I could just be a better son, my dad would come back and live with us again. We&#x2019;d all be happy then.&#x201d;<br> <br>He paused, then added, &#x201c;So, I played every sport at my schools and all the summer sports I could sign up for. I thought that if I could just hit enough home runs or score enough touchdowns or shoot enough baskets, my dad would be proud of me and would come back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did it work?&#x201d; I asked gently.<br> <br>Sean shook his head. &#x201c;My dad only showed up at three of my games during ten years that I was involved in sports. It was no big deal to him. I tried my best to impress him, but I always felt that I&#x2019;d failed. I haven&#x2019;t heard from my dad for the past two years, and I probably never will. I thought I had gotten past caring, until . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>I leaned forward a little.<br> <br>&#x201c;Until what, Sean?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Until I got my quiz back from you day before yesterday,&#x201d; he said, looking directly at me. &#x201c;You praised me . . . and you called me son. You might have meant it just as a passing catchphrase from an older man to a younger fellow, but it hit me like a freight train. I realized at that moment, that all my life I&#x2019;ve wanted to have a man whom I looked up to, to tell me he was proud of me and to call me son. You have no idea what this note on this paper means to me. I plan to keep this for the rest of my life.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sean wiped another sudden rush of tears from his eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;I came here to tell you something, Dr. Hensley. I want you to know that I&#x2019;m going to conduct my life from here on out&#x2014;in everything I do&#x2014;so that you will always be proud enough to call me son. I won&#x2019;t ever let you down. I promise you that. You&#x2019;ve given me something that I&#x2019;ve been yearning for my entire life, and I want to protect it.&#x201d;<br> <br>He rose, and so did I. I shook his hand and gave him a manly hug, concluding with a slap on the shoulder. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a fine man, Sean,&#x201d; I assured him. &#x201c;I have no doubt you&#x2019;ll make me proud of you in whatever you do in life.&#x201d;<br> <br>A year later, Sean graduated with his degree in elementary education. He passed the licensing examination for Indiana and took a job in one of the worst elementary schools in inner-city Indianapolis. Most of the students there were from single-parent families, and all were desperately poor. Sean became a surrogate father to many of them. He would take his old van into the projects and ghettos and pick up dozens of children and take them to sporting events, Saturday movies, or vacation Bible school. He called the boys &#x201c;son&#x201d; and the girls &#x201c;daughter,&#x201d; and they loved it.<br> <br>In calling Sean &#x201c;son,&#x201d; I not only changed his life, I gave him a focus on the ministry he wanted for his lifetime calling. He&#x2019;s now changing the lives of hundreds of other fatherless children.<br> <br>Yes, indeed, one word of encouragement can change the world.*<br><br>&nbsp;<br> BREAKING IT DOWN<p></p> <br>That&#x2019;s power. One perfect word. Yet in this information age words swirl around us every day. Tens of thousands of words&#x2014; maybe a hundred thousand words on a crazy, busy day. We read newspapers, we check out blogs, we may follow Facebook and even Twitter. We respond to e-mail and we listen to real people talking ...and talking...and talking. We drive with the radio on. We try to squeeze in time to read books and magazines. We may turn on the television at night. Words come at us incessantly.<br> <br>But God says in Ecclesiastes 6:11, &#x201c;The more the words, the less the meaning, and how does that profit anyone?&#x201d;<br> <br>Hmmm. Maybe we need to go on a word diet. My children loved Dr. Seuss&#x2019;s books, especially <i>Green Eggs and Ham</i>. Did you know that book grew out of a challenge? After Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, had written several books, his editor Bennett Cerf challenged him to write a story using no more than fifty different words. <i>Green Eggs and Ham</i> was the result. What a delightfully madcap story to be penned out of a strict word budget.2<br> <br>So, what if, instead of tens of thousands of words every day, we meditated on just one book for a lifetime? That narrows it down. My NIV Bible weighs in at 727,969 words, according to the <i>New International Version Exhaustive Concordance</i>. Each year has a little more than 525,900 minutes in it. If we live to be eighty years old, that&#x2019;s about 42,000,000 minutes. If you subtract time for working, sleeping, and play, that still leaves a few million minutes. Meditating on one book is definitely doable in a lifetime, right?<br> <br>But what if we focused on only one passage? I started memorizing Scripture years ago when I first moved to Port Orchard, Washington. Those were some troubling times for me. I didn&#x2019;t recognize it at the time, but I was going through a deep spiritual battle. In retrospect I look back on that battle and see it as a major milestone in my spiritual life because it was then I started memorizing the Bible. One verse at a time, I made God&#x2019;s Word a living, breathing part of who I am. I can&#x2019;t even imagine who I&#x2019;d be today if I had not taken that step.<br> <br>In 1999, I memorized the third chapter of Ephesians. In my prayer journal toward the end of that year I wrote,<br> <br>&nbsp;<br><br><i>Help me to know You more and more. Plant Your words in my heart so that all I need do is recall a verse and instantly feel its power, instantly feel the immeasurable sense of Your love engulf me. This year has been an incredible experience. Each day as I recite the passage I&#x2019;m touched again by the sheer wonder and depth of emotion I feel in Paul&#x2019;s prayer.</i><br><br>&nbsp;<br> <br>I closed my written prayer with a request: &#x201c;May my own words touch lives for You.&#x201d; That one book, the Bible, has changed my life.<br> <br>But forget whole passages for now. Let&#x2019;s break it down even further. What if I had one word&#x2014;just one word&#x2014;to meditate on for a whole day? How rich would that day be? Being a word person, I can&#x2019;t think of anything quite as fun as to luxuriate in one single word for the whole day, turning it around and looking at it from every angle.<br> <br>And it doesn&#x2019;t have to be a complicated word. In his book <i>Orthodoxy</i>, G. K. Chesterton says, &#x201c;Long words go rattling by us like long railway trains. We know they are carrying thousands who are too tired or too indolent to walk and think for themselves. It is good exercise to try for once in a way to express any opinion one holds in words of one syllable.&#x201d;3<br> <br>God continues to tell us, &#x201c;Be still . . .&#x201d; In this barrage of wordiness, what does stillness look like? Maybe it means we take it one step farther and explore just one word for a whole year.<br> ONE PERFECT WORD<p></p> <br>For almost twenty years I&#x2019;ve been meeting with a group of women entrepreneurs for breakfast once a week. Many years back, my breakfast-club ladies and I decided to do just that: every January we&#x2019;ve each selected a word to serve as a personal focus for the year. Over time the words I&#x2019;ve chosen have had a powerful impact on my life.<br> <br>But the title of this book is <i>One Perfect Word</i>. <i>Perfect</i>. Talk about pressure. If I was the one doing the word choice for each year I&#x2019;d never be so bold as to call that choice <i>perfect</i>. The surprising thing is that when we decide we want to focus on one word for the year, God takes part in the choosing. That&#x2019;s why the word is perfect for us. We may not see it at the time, but as we look back we see that it all worked together&#x2014;our word, our life, our journey.<br> <br>When I find my word and begin to explore it, God takes me deep into that one word. Because I&#x2019;ve kept journals nearly my entire life, I have been able to look back at them in the light of my word of the year and see how my life experiences dovetailed with my exploration of that year&#x2019;s word. Preparing to write this book has been an eye-opening journey.<br> <br>In John 15:7, the Lord says, &#x201c;If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.&#x201d; That could be the story of my life. As I&#x2019;ve tried to remain in Him and tuck His words deep in my soul, I&#x2019;ve asked, I&#x2019;ve imagined, and I&#x2019;ve dreamed. The second part of that verse says, &#x201c;Ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.&#x201d; I have to confess, God&#x2019;s blessed me far beyond that for which I have asked. Why should that be such a big surprise? That verse carries a promise. And God always keeps His promises.<br> <br>When we choose one single word from His Word and spend a year with it, I&#x2019;ve found that the Lord takes us by the hand and walks us through the year, teaching us about that word, about ourselves, and even more, about God Himself.<br> <br>There are two things I hope to accomplish in the pages of this book. First, I want to encourage you to begin the practice of focusing on one perfect word each year. We&#x2019;ll talk about how to find the word, how to explore it, and how to recognize the life lessons that grow out of that exploration.<br> <br>Second, I&#x2019;ve chosen fourteen of my own words of the year to share with you. By telling stories that illustrate each particular word&#x2014;some from my life and some from others&#x2019; lives&#x2014;and showing some of what I&#x2019;ve learned about the word, I&#x2019;m hoping you&#x2019;ll see God&#x2019;s fingerprints all over the exercise.<br> <br>Sometimes my entries in my prayer journal over the years&#x2014;my written prayers&#x2014;express my one perfect word in the moment of discovery. In that case, you&#x2019;ll see the prayer set alongside the text.<br> <br>Once in a while, I&#x2019;ll have a practical tip as to how to make a word come alive in a different medium. Some of us are more visual or tactile. I will share hints I&#x2019;ve gleaned on making the word of the year tangible. You&#x2019;ll find those tips labeled &#x201c;Wordplay&#x201d; and set apart in a box.<br> CHOOSING THE WORD<p></p> <br>In preparing for the start of a new year, I always go over my goals for the previous year, doing an intensive postmortem, so to speak. Which goals did I reach? Which did I exceed? Which do I need to rethink or restrategize? I usually read over my journals to get an overview of the year past. Often my word becomes clear during this time of introspection.<br> <br>Sometimes, though, I don&#x2019;t get the word until a couple of weeks into the new year.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m not one for New Year&#x2019;s resolutions because they usually don&#x2019;t lend themselves to developing the strategy needed to carry them out. I am a goal-oriented person. I set goals and then go about devising ways to reach my yearly objectives.<br> <br>Your word for the year is different from goals and resolutions. You don&#x2019;t necessarily choose a goal word like, say, <i>advancement</i>. The word is likely to be a complex concept that you will use throughout the year to explore a new aspect of your relationship with God and others. It needs to be something you will be happy to chew on for fifty-two weeks.<br> LISTENING FOR THE WORD<p></p> <br>My friend, fellow writer, and plotting partner Rachel Hauck also chooses a word each year.

He lives with his wife, Rennie, in Houston, Texas.A detective goes demon hunting in this supernatural mystery from the bestselling author of Ishmael. Chicago sexagenarian private eye Howard Sheim is hired by millionaire Aaron Fischer to probe the existence of Baal, Ashtoroth and Moloch, "false gods" named in the Old Testament book of Exodus. The search leads him to a self-styled mystic who, after reading his future with tarot cards, refers Howard to a teenage seer, Richard Holloway. The boy tells him that there are those living among us-he calls them "yoo-hoos"-who are not really human, though he has no idea exactly what they are. After consulting a rabbi and a warlock, the skeptical Howard is about ready to throw in the towel and go back to his missing-person cases. The narrative switches to follow the quixotic odyssey of 42-year-old Midwesterner David Kennesey, who suddenly abandons his wife and 12-year-old son and heads west without a thought to his destination. Separately, his wife and son embark on their own quests to find him. After adventures in Chicago and Vegas, David stumbles into a mountain Shangri-La inhabited by a woman named Andrea and her coterie of oddball denizens. Back in Chicago, Howard-now with David's son-tracks David to Andrea's, where he finds out that the gods are alive and up to their old tricks. Quinn's playful metaphysical sleuthing and cast of chimerical figures are entertaining, but fans of Ishmael and After Dachau may feel that this book doesn't have quite the originality or moral weight of his earlier efforts.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cult Movies 2: 50 More of the Classics, the Sleepers, the Weird, and the Wonderful</h2><p>More movies considered as &#34;cult&#34; include: Altered States, Bride of Frankenstein, Clockwork Orange, dark Star, Godzilla, King of the Monsters, and many, many more.</p><p></p><h2>American Bible Society Women of the Bible: Heroines and the Lessons They Can Still Teach Us</h2><p>A riveting guide to the women of the Bible, this book will offer the intriguing stories and relevant lessons from Bible characters as Esther, Sarah, Ruth and Mary Magdalene.

Though she might well have weathered the oppressive regime, Humbert was stirred to action by the atrocities she witnessed. In an act of astonishing bravery, she joined forces with several colleagues to form an organized resistance&#x2015;very likely the first such group to fight back against the occupation. (In fact, their newsletter, <i>Rï¿½sistance</i>, gave the French Resistance its name.) </p><p>In the throes of their struggle for freedom, the members of Humbert's group were betrayed to the Gestapo; Humbert herself was imprisoned. In immediate, electrifying detail, Humbert describes her time in prison, her deportation to Germany, where for more than two years she endured a string of brutal labor camps, and the horror of discovering that seven of her friends were executed by a firing squad. But through the direst of conditions, and ill health in the labor camps, Humbert retains hope for herself, for her friends, and for humanity.</p><p>Originally published in France in 1946, the book was soon forgotten and is now translated into English for the first time. <i>Rï¿½sistance</i> is more than a firsthand account of wartime France: it is the work of a brave, witty, and forceful woman, a true believer who refused to go quietly.</p></p><p><p><b>Agn</b><b>ï¿½s Humbert</b> was a distinguished art historian and a member of the Museï¿½ de l'Homme group in the French Resistance. She survived the war and died in Valmondois, France, in 1963.</p><p><b>Barbara Mellor</b> is a translator specializing in the fine and decorative arts, art history, architectural history, fashion, design, and all things French. During her researches into a Resistance ambush of a German armored column in Aveyron, she stumbled across the 1946 edition of <i>Rï¿½sistance</i>.</p>From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Tobias Grey A middle-aged divorcï¿½e with two grown-up children and a respectable job as an art historian, Agnï¿½s Humbert hardly fit the profile of a typical French resistance hero. Or did she? In 1940 most French men of fighting age had been taken prisoner by the Germans in what became known as the "debacle." The first members of French resistance cells in Paris, where Humbert worked at the prestigious Musï¿½e des Arts et Traditions Populaires, were a mixture of women, older men and teenagers whose imaginations had been fired by a radio speech given by the little-known Gen. Charles de Gaulle. "How bizarre it all is!" noted Humbert in her journal on Oct. 20, 1940. "Here we are, most of us the wrong side of forty, careering along like students all fired up with passion and fervour, in the wake of a leader of whom we know absolutely nothing, of whom none of us has ever seen a photograph." With thrilling immediacy, Humbert's book guides us through the first stumbling steps of what became known as the Musï¿½e de l'Homme group, a disparate cell of writers, linguists, historians and social gadflies led by a charismatic Polish ethnographer, Boris Vildï¿½. The cell's greatest achievement, before it was broken up by the Nazis in April 1941, was to publish and deliver five editions of a four-page broadsheet newspaper called, naturally, "Rï¿½sistance." The paper's main aim was to counter Nazi propaganda, notably by providing evidence that food shortages in France were being caused not by the British blockade but by wholesale looting by the Germans. More than 60 years after it was first published, Humbert's book, one of the first memoirs of the war to enter the public domain, has finally been translated into English. It was worth the wait: Barbara Mellor not only captures Humbert's reckless spirit but also her very Parisian sense of humor, at turns mordant and sarcastic. Compared to such famed wartime diaries as Norman Lewis's Naples '44 or The Diary of Anne Frank, which are easily categorized as having been written in the heat of the moment, or even The Journal of Hï¿½lï¿½ne Berr, reviewed in these pages last week, Rï¿½sistance is a curious hybrid. The first two chapters, covering the French defeat and the first months of the Occupation, are the transcription of Humbert's personal journal from June 1940 up to her arrest by the Gestapo in April 1941. The rest of the book, indeed the major part of it, she wrote retrospectively. After a year of brutal imprisonment and interrogation in French jails, she became one of the earliest French deportees to Germany, where she endured three years of forced labor, mostly in a rayon factory where chemicals bit into her hands and face. When she was at last liberated by the U.S. Third Army, she immediately set about completing her war-time journal. The memories flooded back: "On 13 April [1941] my diary ends; yet my memories are so clear that I am able to commit them to paper as they happened and in strict sequence. I remember everything as clearly as though it was written in notebooks, one event after another. Slowly turning the pages, I find that virtually every one is illustrated with some barbaric image or other." Humbert, who trained to be a painter, writes with remarkable pictorial skill, frequently drawing inspiration from favorite tableaux such as Ingrï¿½s "Turkish Bath" or the film "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari." All of her retrospective diary entries are written in the present tense, a remarkably daring stylistic innovation. But it works because Humbert throws herself into the task of recollection just as recklessly and utterly as she did into the resistance. What we will never know is whether Humbert, who died at 69 in 1963, tampered with her original diary entries before publication. (If the Gestapo had discovered these opening chapters as they appear now, it would have been able to arrest every member of the Musï¿½e de l'Homme Groupe. As it was, some managed to escape detention when the cell was broken up.) Were they written in code? Where did she hide them? Why are there so few references to her private life? Did she always intend to publish them? What seems to have decided Humbert to do so was her experience in German prison camps : "I say to myself: 'In fifty years' time my family will know how I was treated by the Germans. I have a grandson, Yves. He will tell his children how I was forced to work beyond the limits of human endurance.' " <br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

In a hospital, rotten stuff that happened to people at least got dealt with pronto and you ended up knowing what the outcome was going to be. You had a car wreck, you got carted to Emergency, you got patched up or operated on, you lived, or you died. It all took time, but the time ended. In a rehab center, though, everything went on and on. Especially if you had a stroke.<br><br>That was what Seth Darrow was thinking as he watched his grandfather in one of the physical therapy rooms at Penn Cove Care, which was situated on a leafy side street in the old Victorian town of Coupeville on Whidbey Island. Seth and his dad had just engaged in a depressing meeting with the head of PT, a woman who'd spent twenty-five years in the military and who had a way of speaking that pretty much showed it. The news they'd been given had matched the weather outside, which was wintertime bleak with a sky pouring down a fifteenth straight day of steady rain accompanied by the occasional wind gust that was taking down aged alders and lofty Douglas firs across the island.<br><br>"Mr. Darrow still isn't working with us," she announced to Seth and his dad ten seconds after they'd sat in front of her desk. Her name plate called her G. H. Fieldstone, and she'd introduced herself as George. Then she'd added <i>doctor</i>&nbsp;in front of it, just in case they'd considered getting friendly. "This has to change," she said. "This is a rehab facility, with the accent on <i>rehab</i>. If Mr. Darrow doesn't make more progress..." She did one of those lifting of the finger routines, which meant they were to fill in the blanks. She looked severely at Seth's dad, Rich. It seemed she thought he was thick as a board because she added, "This isn't a permanent living facility. You understand."<br><br>She then suggested that they have a look for themselves from the hallway outside of the PT room where Ralph Darrow was working with the occupational therapist. That was what they were doing at the moment, and Seth's heart thudded painfully as he watched his grandfather.<br><br>It had been more than four weeks since the stroke that had robbed Ralph Darrow of speech and the ability to use his right arm. His right leg had been affected, too, but not as badly as his arm. He'd more or less got back the use of the leg, which was good news, although he was still unsteady. But when it came to the arm, he was toast. The damage was done, the arm was finito, and what he had to do was learn how to be left handed. He also had to learn how to use his left hand to exercise his right arm so that it didn't develope something called contractures. If that happened, his right arm's muscles would totally freeze up as the muscles thickened.&nbsp;<br><br>So once he got steadier on his feet, Ralph had PT sessions for his arm several times a day. He also had speech therapy sessions twice a day to handle the loss of language. The situation Ralph was in would've been a bummer for anyone, but for Seth's grandfather, who for the last fifty-two of his seventy-three years had been a carpenter, a gardener, and a forester who maintained well over one hundred acres of woodland, it was like a death blow.</p><h2>Knitting Scandinavian Slippers and Socks</h2><p><p>Discover beautiful knitting patterns that incorporate both twined and stranded knitting.</p><ul><li>Instructions are given for casting on at the heel and working toward the toe for excellent fit; options include removable felted insoles for even greater comfort</li><li>Both women's and men's knitting patterns included--perfect for gifts</li><li>Patterns feature a mix of traditional Scandinavian designs and modern variations</li></ul></p><p>Laura Farson, author of the popular <i>New Twists on Twined Knitting,</i> presents beautiful knitting patterns for cozy, comfortable, durable slippers-plus a number of coordinating socks.<p>Laura Farson is the author of several books and numerous articles on quilting, knitting, and weaving.

Just a little bit closer.</i><br><br>Hidden by lush, dewy foliage, Layel watched as the dragon army marched through the detestably named Forest of Dragons. Where they were going, he didn't know. <i>Why </i>they were going, he didn't know, either. He only knew that he was going to relieve them of their burden. A young&#x2014; human?&#x2014;female was bound and gagged inside a portable prison. That prison was balanced by two wooden beams slung over several of the warriors' shoulders, swaying with their movements.<br><br>Obviously, she was their enemy.<br><br>He didn't know the girl, but a dragon's enemy was his dearest friend. And he didn't like his friends being bound.<br><br>The dragons continued to march forward, slowly, steadily. He motioned for his own army to hold... remain composed. They obeyed without hesitation. Since that dark day two hundred years ago, he had happily led his men with an iron fist&#x2014;straight into a never-ending war. His will was not questioned. Ever. Not without severe consequences.<br><br>"... not going to end well," Brand, second-in-command of the dragon soldiers, was saying. Golden light seeped from the crystal dome that surrounded all of Atlantis, forming a halo around his pale, braided hair and disgustingly handsome features.<br><br>Brand was strong, brave, loyal to his king, kind to his people. A pity he was a dragon. Had he been born even a demon, Layel thought perhaps he would have liked him. As it was, he wanted Brand alive long enough to take a mate. A mate Layel would then steal. Brand would suffer, for a little while at least, and then Layel would gut him.<br><br>Brand had not been one of the warriors present all those years ago&#x2014;none of the warriors here had been present, for Layel had slaughtered them all. Remembering their deaths, he smiled. Not all of them had faded quickly. Some he had lingered over, enjoying their pain, taking his time with every slice and bite.<br><br>Still, killing those responsible hadn't been enough. Not for the horrendous crimes that had been committed against Susan. Hadn't he been blamed for the actions of others? It was only fair to use that same logic against the dragons.<br><br>Only when Layel had obliterated the entire race would Susan be avenged. And only then would Layel deserve to join her in the hereafter. <i>Soon, my love. Soon.</i><br><br>"If her sisters see her like this, there will be a war," a dragon called Renard said.<br><br>Renard was a dark-haired tyrant who, Layel knew, had studied how best to kill every race in Atlantis. The demons, the nymphs, the centaurs, the gorgons and all the other creatures the gods had deemed mistakes in their quest to create humans. Of them all, Renard hated vampires most and was always eager for a fight.<br><br>Eager himself, Layel ran his tongue over his elongated teeth.<br><br>"What else could we do?" an irritated voice proclaimed.<br><br>Tagart. Untamed, almost feral, with black hair and an even blacker heart. He was loyal to no one and was even jealous of his own king. "One more word out of that girl's mouth and I would have cut out her tongue. We <i>had </i>to gag her."<br><br>All of the soldiers nodded. Each was taller and more muscled than the last, and each had a long, menacing sword strapped to his bare back, nestled between the slits that hid his wings. Layel collected those swords and hung them on his walls as trophies. He used their bones as furniture.<br><br>"Whatever our reasons for binding her, they won't understand. Even though we're taking her back to them. Kind of. If we can find their camp." Brand again. "She's their beloved, their future queen."<br><br>Sisters... beloved... queen.<br><br>Amazons, Layel realized.<br><br>His lips curled in another slow grin. Fierce creatures, the Amazons. Devoted to each other, bloodthirsty, though they mostly kept to themselves unless provoked. Oh, yes. And vicious. Legend claimed that anyone who threatened an Amazon would soon find his deepest fear bearing down on him. A shadow, a determined phantom that would devour him whole.<br><br>Yes, the stories of their conquests were endless, though Layel himself had never fought one, never tasted one. He had no interest in doing so, either. Always before, they had been a nonentity to him, unworthy of his time or consideration, for he existed simply to torment the dragons. Nothing more.<br><br>But now his mind whirled with ways he might be able to use them. Perhaps he should not liberate this captive, after all. Perhaps <i>he </i>should find the Amazon camp, lie and tell them the dragons meant the girl harm, perhaps meant to kill her in front of them. The dragons would have their asses handed to them by little girls. Now wouldn't that just be&#x2014;<br><br>A loud, piercing war cry sounded.<br><br>What seemed like hundreds of warrior women but could only have been a handful suddenly burst from the trees.

The metallic scent wafted to Layel's nostrils, sweet and tangy. He breathed it in deeply, felt it sweep through his entire body, fuse with sinew and bone and ignite a guttural hunger.<br><br>"Now!" Layel shouted to his men.<br><br>Together, they rushed forward. How he would have loved to simply materialize in the midst of battle, but he could not. None of them could. Well, not if they hoped to survive. A vampire could materialize anywhere he wanted with only a thought, but there were consequences. Once they reached their destination, they were drained. Exhausted. Unable to move for hours. Escape was the only time the ability proved useful, and he didn't want to escape this.<br><br>As he reached the dragon masses, sword swinging, slicing, light from the upper dome warmed his sensitive skin, all the hotter as it blended with the dragons' kiss of fire. He did not allow either to slow him, however. Sweat streaked down his chest and back. His wrist flicked left and right in constant motion, giving his blade a fluidity that cut through dragon flesh as smoothly as if it were cutting through water.<br><br>He reveled in every drop of crimson that he spilled, rejoiced with every body that fell. Every pain-entrenched shout brought a new smile to his lips. More than anything, he loved seeing his opponents' golden eyes as their minds registered his blow. They always widened; horror always filled them. The light inside always died right along with them.<br><br>Later, when the fighting was done, he would have to stalk through the masses and remove their heads. Dragons, like vampires, healed quickly. He liked to eliminate any possibility of regeneration. But right now, with fire dancing in every direction, he could only cut their decayed hearts in half.<br><br>Two dragons rushed him from different angles.<br><br>Ducking low, he arced his sword forward with one hand, slashing through one warrior's stomach while withdrawing a dagger from his waist with his other hand, then reaching out, leaning... stretching... and stabbing the second warrior in the groin. There was an unholy scream.<br><br>Both warriors collapsed.<br><br>Grinning, he leapt back into motion. Someone swept in front of him and managed to nick his side. He hissed, saw that one of his men, Zane, was already chopping his way forward to aid him. Layel didn't go in for the kill himself but kicked the dragon in the stomach, sending him flying in Zane's direction. Seeing this, the battle-hungry vampire spun, sword singing with lethal menace.<br><br>Seconds before the dragon's head rolled, he unleashed a blistering stream of flames. As the body dropped, those flames found a target on Layel's cheek. He wiped at the charred, sizzling skin. Felt a warm trail of dragon blood drip down his arm. Grinned again. He still held the dagger and the blade gleamed a vivid crimson.<br><br>"You are well, yes?" Zane asked him, breath sawing in and out.<br><br>He nodded. <i>More. Need more. </i>Needed to inflict more injury, more carnage. His focus landed on a nearby dragon already engaged in a fierce fight with a vampire. Layel stalked forward and swung, gutting the creature without warning. There was a grunt, a jerk. The body toppled. Did Layel mind striking from behind? Never. Fighting fairly would ensure nothing but failure.<br><br>Another dragon railed at him. Moving faster than the eye could see, he stabbed the bastard in the belly, pulled out, stabbed in the heart, pulled out again and stabbed in the neck. Only three seconds had passed. Too quick, too easy, he thought.<br><br><i>More.</i><br><br>Brand, ripping an Amazon off his chest and tossing her to the ground, came into view. Yes, Layel thought, tracing his tongue over his sharpened teeth in anticipation. That one. That one would die today. No more waiting. He would not simply incapacitate the bastard; he would kill.<br><br>Layel kicked and bit his way through the ranks, gaze locked on the dragon captain. Halfway there, he heard a growl behind him, pivoted to dispatch the threat swiftly and return his attention to Brand. But his sword slashed and clanged against another sword, jarring him. No easy, unprepared kill this time, apparently.<br><br>He blinked as an Amazon swirled in front of him, swinging at him a second time. <i>Clink. </i>Scowling, he blocked her third thrust. <i>Clang.</i><br><br>"I do not wish to hurt you," he gritted out.<br><br>"How admirable," she replied drily&#x2014;before swinging at him again.<br><br>He twisted to the side, barely escaping the sharp tip. Had she just mocked him?<br><br>Wind gusted past them, lifting her cerulean-colored hair off her face. Suddenly Layel was granted a full view of breathtaking, incomparable beauty. Beauty even the war paint couldn't hide. Beauty that nearly felled him. Definitely rendered him dumb, for he ceased moving. Brand who?<br><br>Layel hadn't taken the time to appreciate the beauty of a woman in two hundred years, yet he was helpless to do anything but drink this one in, this fantasy come to life. It was as though she exuded something...magical? Something that forced the eye to her. Something that would not release its hold. But Amazons weren't able to weave spells. Only dragons could.<br><br>He continued his scrutiny of her, searching for signs of a dragon relative. Her eyes were so bright a violet they sparkled like freshly polished amethysts. Long black lashes. Slightly rounded cheeks. Flawless, bronzed skin where the paint had washed away. Unlike most of her hulking sisters, she was of the petite variety, barely reaching his shoulders. No, no dragon.<br><br>From her fluid grace to her perfect curves, she was sensual and exotic, ready for a bedding rather than a battle.<br><br>"You should not be here. I could have killed you, woman." He didn't mind killing females, had done so on many occasions, but it would have been a shame to destroy something so lovely. His jaw clenched as he realized exactly what he was thinking. Damn her. He did not regard women with any kind of desire. Not anymore.<br><br>One corner of her lush, red mouth kicked up, causing his stomach to tighten. "Please," she said, voice sultry, like a dream. "You'll need a few centuries' more sword practice before you have the skill to eliminate me, vampire." She swung at him yet again, this time aiming for his neck.<br><br>There were no creatures faster than the vampires, and he managed to arch backward with swift precision as the blade soared just over his nose. "And you fancy yourself my tutor? I think not." But he admired her confidence.<br><br>"What are you doing here?" she demanded. Another swing.<br><br>Another block. "Helping you."<br><br>A tinkling laugh escaped her, floating over his skin with the surety of a lover's caress. His stomach tightened again. He scowled, mouth thinning over razor-sharp teeth. How was she affecting him like this?<br><br>He had not experienced even a single wisp of need since&#x2014;<i>do not think of Susan. You will lose focus.</i><br><br>Growling, he swung at the Amazon. She blocked the harder blow and frowned. Better. A frown was better than a laugh. And so he did it again. Slashed at her, using all of his might. When their swords next met, both of their bodies vibrated from the impact.<br><br>Her delicate nose twitched. In irritation? Amusement? Delight?<br><br>Surely not the latter two.<br><br><i>"This </i>is how you help me?" she demanded.<br><br>"No. That was me, helping myself. Now this is me, helping you." With a swift jerk of his arm, he tossed his<br><br>dagger. The tip embedded in the neck of the dragon racing toward her from behind. "See the difference?"<br><br>She spun, surveyed the fallen, dying warrior. When she faced Layel again, there was no longer any question about what emotion she experienced. Irritation. "Well, we don't need your help and will not grant you any type of boon for offering it."<br><br>"Your gratitude is humbling. Fortunately, cutting out the hearts of my enemies is boon enough for me."<br><br>The pink tip of her tongue emerged and traced over those lush lips, smearing war paint. All the while she eyed <i>his </i>lips. Had his words... excited her? Shock rooted him in place, staying his sword. Such depravity should have disgusted her. And her excitement should have disgusted him.<br><br>Should have.<br><br>He hissed at her, suddenly as desperate to get away from her as he was to dispatch the dragon army. "Get in my way again, Amazon, and I will take <i>you </i>down." Perhaps he would not need to, he thought, before he could turn from her. Already another dragon closed in behind her.<br><br>Layel's vehemence seemed to shake her out of her inactivity. She returned his hiss with one of her own. "Try, and you'll die like the dragons." As she spoke, she stabbed behind her, sinking the apex of her sword into the very dragon that had been sneaking up on her. She gave a twist of her wrist, digging her weapon deeper, causing even more pain for the injured man.<br><br>Her gaze never left Layel.<br><br>The warrior fell to the ground, a final gasp echoing from him.<br><br>Layel didn't waste another moment. He moved around and behind the woman and her lethal beauty, knowing he was nothing more than a blur to her. She didn't have time to turn when he kicked out his leg. Contact. Her ankles knocked together. She grunted and toppled to her knees. But she was back on her feet in the next instant, spinning around and glaring at him.</p><h2>Stretching the Truth (Sweet Valley Twins #13) (A Bantam-Skylark Book)</h2><p>What&#39;s wrong with Mary Robinson?

His groundbreaking work not only rejects all theories of truth but also dismisses modern epistemology and its preoccupation with knowledge and representation. At the same time, the celebrated pragmatist believed there could be no universally valid answers to moral questions, which led him to a complex view of religion rarely expressed in his writings.<br><br>In this posthumous publication, Rorty, a strict secularist, finds in the pragmatic thought of John Dewey, John Stuart Mill, William James, and George Santayana, among others, a political imagination shared by religious traditions. His intent is not to promote belief over nonbelief or to blur the distinction between religious and public domains. Rorty seeks only to locate patterns of similarity and difference so an ethics of decency and a politics of solidarity can rise. He particularly responds to Pope Benedict XVI and his campaign against the relativist vision. Whether holding theologians, metaphysicians, or political ideologues to account, Rorty remains steadfast in his opposition to absolute uniformity and its exploitation of political strength.</p><p>Richard Rorty (1931-2007) was professor of comparative literature and philosophy at Stanford University.

And yet, in each of the four very different poets she considers here, Helen Vendler reveals a style of thinking in operation; although they may prefer different means, she argues, all poets of any value are thinkers. </p><p> The four poets taken up in this volume--Alexander Pope, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, and William Butler Yeats--come from three centuries and three nations, and their styles of thinking are characteristically idiosyncratic. Vendler shows us Pope performing as a satiric miniaturizer, remaking in verse the form of the essay, Whitman writing as a poet of repetitive insistence for whom thinking must be followed by rethinking, Dickinson experimenting with plot to characterize life's unfolding, and Yeats thinking in images, using montage in lieu of argument. </p><p> With customary lucidity and spirit, Vendler traces through these poets' lines to find evidence of thought in lyric, the silent stylistic measures representing changes of mind, the condensed power of poetic thinking. Her work argues against the reduction of poetry to its (frequently well-worn) themes and demonstrates, instead, that there is always in admirable poetry a strenuous process of thinking, evident in an evolving style--however ancient the theme--that is powerful and original. </p></p><p>Helen Vendler is A. Kingsley Porter University Professor at Harvard University.Poetry is often regarded as the product of inspiration rather than intellect. Vendler seeks to emphasize the importance of thought in poetry...She shows poetic thought as reflected in poetic voice, structure, and prosody in four poets: Alexander Pope, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, and W. B. Yeats...Vendler's convincing and illuminating arguments make this book highly recommended.<br> --Amy K. Weiss (<i>Library Journal</i> 2004-08-01)<br><br>[Vendler's] thoughtful and insightful readings of poems by Alexander Pope, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson and William Butler Yeats demonstrate the central and indeed essential role of sophisticated thinking in the poetic enterprise...To navigate the intricacies of thought that a poem contains, it is hard to imagine a better guide than Vendler herself. Her most admirable achievement is perhaps her ability to illuminate the connection between what a poem says and the formally oriented issue of how it says it. One might have expected a book explicitly on poetic thinking to neglect form, and focus only on content. But Vendler considers this approach a serious mistake, and her insights regarding form constitute the strongest argument for this position.<br> --Troy Jollimore (<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> 2004-10-10)<br><br>Some people seem surprised by the idea that poets do any thinking at all. There is a popular image of the poet as a wild, inspired, untutored and half-mad figure striding across the heath. Helen Vendler's new book, <i>Poet's Thinking</i>, if it is read as widely as it ought to be, will help considerably to correct this misperception. (<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> 2004-10-17)<br><br>In her challenging and entertaining new book, <i>Poets Thinking</i>, Helen Vendler argues that poetry in all its manifestations, however ostensibly irrational, is a mode of thinking that commands not just our aesthetic appreciation but also our intellectual respect...Vendler is a wonderful elucidator of individual poems. Nobody writes more insightfully about a poem's stylistic armature, and the emotional and intellectual purposes that armature serves. And by examining the distinctive strategies of thinking in the work of such radically different poets as Pope, Whitman, Dickinson, and Yeats, Vendler makes visible aspects of style and language that other critics simply haven't seen.<br> --Alan Shapiro (<i>Harvard Magazine</i> 2005-01-01)<br><br>One of the most distinguished critics of poetry in the English-speaking world...Vendler engages in close reading to find a poem's distinctiveness of language and literary form...Vendler is really trying to enlarge our idea of what poetry can be...In reminding us to look at and listen to the actual words on the page, and not to leap too soon to some hackneyed idea that they recall, Vendler invites us to expand our own response to experience.<br> --Christopher Benfey (<i>New York Review of Books</i> 2005-04-28)<br><br>Vendler's close readings lay bare the process of poetic reflection: <i>Poets Thinking</i> is about how rather than what poets think, about the act of the mind rather than any 'embalmed thought' that readers might want to extract from verse...Vendler is exceptionally skilled at demonstrating that poetry offers us pictures of the mind at work rather than settled axioms to take away...[<i>Poets Thinking</i>] has a good deal to offer in the way of thought-provoking and sometimes dazzling readings of British and American poetry.<br> --Fiona Green (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i> 2005-10-07)<br><br>Helen Vendler's <i>Poets Thinking</i> is lucid, accessible, and inspired...Vendler's own voice is that rare academic combination of expertise and accommodation...Her arguments provide ample explanation and exempla for the lay reader while provoking the academic to revisit old assumptions. She is at ease with the broad sweep of American and English poetry and with the critical methods of the last half-century. Her conclusions seem remarkably self-evident, a voice of trustworthiness and reason that encourages us to lean closer, to listen carefully.<br> --Lynnell Edwards (<i>Georgia Review</i>)</p><h2>Wildcat: The F4F in WW II</h2><p>A dramatic study of the World War II fighter, from design and development on the Grumman factory floor to combat use in the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps and in the British Fleet Air Arm.</p><p></p><h2>28 Days to a More Magnetic Life</h2><p>The powers of magnetism are not as mystical as you might think.

Sunday Times and New York Times bestselling author Peter V. Brett brings one of the most imaginative fantasy sagas of the twenty-first century to an epic close. The war has begun... For time out of mind, bloodthirsty demons have stalked the night, culling the human race to scattered remnants dependent on half-forgotten magics to protect them. Two heroes arose-men as close as brothers, yet divided by bitter betrayal. Arlen Bales became known as the Painted Man, tattooed head-to-toe with powerful magic symbols that enable him to fight demons in hand-to-hand combat-and emerge victorious. Ahmann Jardir, armed with magically warded weapons, called himself the Deliverer, a figure prophesied to unite humanity and lead them to triumph in Sharak Ka-the final war against demonkind. But in their efforts to bring the war to the demons, Arlen and Jardir have set something in motion that may prove the end of everything they hold dear-a Swarm. Now the war is at hand, and humanity cannot hope to win it unless Arlen and Jardir, with the help of Arlen&#39;s wife, Renna, can bend a captured demon prince to their will and force the devious creature to lead them to the Core, where the Mother of Demons breeds an inexhaustible army. Trusting their closest confidantes, Leesha, Inevera, Ragen, and Elissa, to rally the fractious people of the Free Cities and lead them against the Swarm, Arlen, Renna, and Jardir set out on a desperate quest into the darkest depths of evil-from which none of them expects to return alive.</p><p>Peter V. Brett is the internationally bestselling author of the Demon Cycle series, which has sold over two million copies in twenty-five languages worldwide.

She could only sleep on her side now, something the carriage bench was not designed for. She had taken to curling on the floor like Amanvah and Sikvah in their carriage full of pillows.<br><br>Waves of pain washed over her as uterine muscles tightened and contracted, readying themselves for the task to come. Leesha wasn&#x2019;t due for another thirteen weeks, but it was common for women to experience this.<br><br>And every one of them panics the first time, Bruna used to say, thinking they&#x2019;ll birth early. Even me, though I&#x2019;d smacked dozens of squalling babes into the world before I grunted out one of my own.<br><br>Leesha began breathing in a quick steady rhythm to calm herself and help endure the pain. Pain was nothing new these days. The skin of her stomach was blackened and bruised from powerful fetal blows.<br><br>Several times during her pregnancy, Leesha had been forced to channel powerful ward magic. Each time, the baby reacted violently. Feedback from magic could grant inhuman strength and stamina. It made the old young again, and brought the young to primacy before their time. It heightened emotions and lessened control. Folk in the throes of magic could be violent. Dangerous.<br><br>What might such power do to a child not fully formed? Not even at seven months, Leesha looked and felt full term. She anticipated an early delivery, even welcomed it, lest the child grow too large for natural birth.<br><br>Or punch through my womb and crawl out on its own. Leesha breathed and breathed, but she did not calm, nor did the pain subside.<br><br>All sorts of things can bring a set of contractions, Bruna taught. Like the brat kicking a full bladder.<br><br>Leesha found the chamber pot, but relieving herself did little to ease the spasming. She glanced at the porcelain. Her water was clouded and bloody.<br><br>She froze, mind racing as she stared at the pot. But then the baby kicked hard. She cried out in pain, and she knew.<br><br>It was coming.<br><br>Leesha was propped on the bench by the time Wonda came to report. It was nearly dawn.<br><br>Wonda handed off her reins, rolling off her horse nimbly as a cat. She landed on the lip of the moving carriage and opened the door, effortlessly swinging onto the bench across from Leesha.<br><br>&#x201c;Almost home, mistress, if ya wanna warsh a bit,&#x201d; Wonda said. &#x201c;Gar rode on ahead while ya slept. Just got word back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How bad is it?&#x201d; Leesha asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Bad,&#x201d; Wonda said. &#x201c;Whole staff&#x2019;s turned out. Gar tried to stop it like ya asked. Said it was like trying to pull up a stump bare-handed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Angierians and their ripping ceremony.&#x201d; Leesha grimaced. She was beginning to understand how Duchess Araine could walk past a cloud of bowing and curtsying servants while pretending not to see them at all. Sometimes it was the only way to get where you meant to go.<br><br>&#x201c;Ent just maids and guards,&#x201d; Wonda said. &#x201c;Half the town council&#x2019;s turned up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Night.&#x201d; Leesha put her face in her hands.<br><br>&#x201c;Give the word and I can have a wall of Cutters shuttle you right inside,&#x201d; Wonda said. &#x201c;Tell everyone yu&#x2019;ll see them when yu&#x2019;ve had yur rest.&#x201d;<br><br>Leesha shook her head. &#x201c;This is my homecoming as countess. I won&#x2019;t begin it by shunning everyone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ay, mistress,&#x201d; Wonda said.<br><br>&#x201c;I need to tell you something, Wonda,&#x201d; Leesha said. &#x201c;But you must remain calm when I do.&#x201d;<br><br>Wonda gave a confused look, then her eyes widened. She began to rise.<br><br>&#x201c;Wonda Cutter, you keep your bottom on that bench.&#x201d; Leesha swung her finger like a lash, and the girl fell back.<br><br>&#x201c;The contractions are sixteen minutes apart,&#x201d; Leesha continued. &#x201c;It may be hours before the baby comes. I&#x2019;m going to be quite dependent on you today, dear, so I need you to listen carefully and stay focused.&#x201d;<br><br>Wonda swallowed heavily, but she nodded. &#x201c;Ay, mistress. Tell me what ya want and I&#x2019;ll make it happen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will exit the carriage at a stately pace and head for the door,&#x201d; Leesha said. &#x201c;I will speak to one person at a time as I walk. At no time do we stop or slow.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ay, mistress,&#x201d; Wonda said.<br><br>&#x201c;I will openly appoint you head of my household guard,&#x201d; Leesha said. &#x201c;If everyone&#x2019;s mustered in the yard as you say, that should be enough for you to take command and send Cutter women to secure the royal manse. Once they have the royal chambers secure, no one gets in save you, me, and Darsy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Vika?&#x201d; Wonda asked.<br><br>Leesha shook her head. &#x201c;Vika will be seeing her husband for the first time in months. I won&#x2019;t take that from them. There&#x2019;s nothing she can do that Darsy can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ay, mistress,&#x201d; Wonda said.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not to tell anyone what is happening,&#x201d; Leesha said. &#x201c;Not the guards, not Gared, not anyone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But mistress . . .&#x201d; Wonda began.<br><br>&#x201c;No one.&#x201d; Her words came out in a growl as Leesha grit her teeth through another contraction. It was like a serpent wrapped around her belly, squeezing. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t have loose talk turning this into a Jongleur&#x2019;s show. I&#x2019;m giving birth to Ahmann Jardir&#x2019;s baby. Not everyone will wish it well, and after the birth we&#x2019;ll both be . . . vulnerable.&#x201d;<br><br>Wonda&#x2019;s eyes hardened. &#x201c;Not while I&#x2019;m around, mistress. Swear it by the sun.&#x201d;<br><br>Wonda gave no sign anything was amiss when she exited the carriage, stepping easily into the stirrup of her moving horse.<br><br>The wardlight inside the carriage dimmed in the early-morning light, but it brightened as the door clicked shut. With it, the wards of silence reactivated, and Leesha let out a groan of pain.<br><br>She put one hand on the small of her back and the other under her heavy belly as she heaved herself upright. Heat wards had the kettle hot in seconds. Leesha poured steaming water on a cloth and pressed it to her face.<br><br>The reflection in the mirror was pale and hollow, dark circles beneath her eyes. Leesha longed to reach into her hora pouch, Drawing a bit of magic to give her strength through the ordeal to come, but it was too dangerous. Magic was known to send the child into wild fits. It was the last thing she wanted now.<br><br>She glanced at the powder kit, but she&#x2019;d never had the skill painting her face that she had painting wards. That was her mother&#x2019;s talent. She made do as best she could, brushing her hair and straightening her dress.<br><br>The roads of Cutter&#x2019;s Hollow&#x2019;s outer boroughs twisted and turned, following the curving shape of the greatwards she and Arlen Bales designed. The Hollow had over a dozen boroughs now, an ever-expanding net of interconnected greatwards that pushed the demons back farther every night. Leesha knew the shape as intimately as a lover, not needing to glance out the window to know they were passing through Newhaven.<br><br>Soon they would enter Cutter&#x2019;s Hollow, the capital of Hollow County and the center of the greatwards. Just two years ago, the Hollow had been a town of less than three hundred souls&#x2014;barely large enough for a dot on the map. Now it was equal to any of the Free Cities.<br><br>Another contraction took her. They were getting closer&#x2014;just six minutes apart now. She was dilating and could feel the child sitting lower. She breathed. There were herbs that could ease her pain, but she dare not take them until she was safely ensconced in her chambers.<br><br>Leesha peeked from the curtain, immediately regretting it as a cheer went up in response. She&#x2019;d hoped to keep her homecoming quiet by arriving before dawn, but there was no quieting an escort of such size. Even at the early hour, folk crowded the streets and watched from windows as the procession wound its way home.<br><br>It was strange, thinking of Thamos&#x2019; keep as home, but it belonged to her now as Countess of Hollow County. In her absence, Darsy had turned Leesha&#x2019;s cottage in the Gatherers&#x2019; Wood into the headquarters for Gatherers&#x2019; Academy, hopefully the first of many establishments of learning in the Hollow. Leesha would rather be there training apprentices, but there was far more she could accomplish if she took up residence in the keep.<br><br>She wrinkled her nose as the fortress came into view. It was a blocky, walled structure, built more for defense than aesthetics&#x2014;at least on the outside. The inside was worse in some ways, lavish as a palace in a land struggling to rebuild. Both problems would have to be addressed now that the place was hers.<br><br>The great gates of the keep were open, the road lined on either side by the remains of the Wooden Lancers, Thamos&#x2019; cavalry. There were barely fifty of them now, the others lost with the count himself in the Battle of Docktown. They were resplendent on their great Angierian mustangs, man and horse equally stone-faced at attention. All were armed and armored, as if expecting Leesha to command them into battle at any moment.<br><br>The courtyard, too, looked mustered as much for a war as a homecoming. To the left, Captain Gamon was mounted with his lieutenants before hundreds of men-at-arms, straight-backed with eyes forward, heavy polearms planted on the ground, points all at precisely the same angle.<br><br>Courtyard right, the entire keep&#x2019;s staff&#x2014;an army in its own right&#x2014;lined up no less sharply than the infantry, uniforms clean and pressed.<br><br>It will be interesting to see what happens to those perfect ranks if I give birth in the courtyard. The thought was wry, but then the child kicked, and it ceased to amuse.<br><br>As Wonda warned, a knot of people stood at the base of the steps to the keep. Lord Arther was at their front, rigid in his dress uniform and spear. Beside him was Tarisa, the count&#x2019;s childhood nurse who had become lady&#x2019;s maid to Leesha. Gared was waiting with Rosal, his promised, and Rosal&#x2019;s mother. With him were Inquisitor Hayes; Gatherers Darsy and Vika; her father, Erny; and . . . night, even Leesha&#x2019;s mother, Elona, glaring daggers at Rosal&#x2019;s back. Leesha prayed the early hour would succor her from that demon, at least, but as usual it went unanswered.<br><br>Wonda poked her head in the door. &#x201c;Ready, mistress?&#x201d;<br><br>A fresh contraction ripped through her. She felt hot, sweating even in the cold winter air.<br><br>Leesha smiled, showing none of it. Her legs shook as she got to her feet, and she felt the child inch lower. &#x201c;Yes, dear. Swiftly now.&#x201d;<br><br>Gamon dismounted as the carriage arrived. He, Arther, and Gared nearly tripped over one another in the scramble to offer their hands as she stepped down. Leesha ignored them all, clutching Wonda&#x2019;s arm as she carefully descended the steps. It would not do to fall in front of the entire assembly.<br><br>&#x201c;Welcome back to the Hollow, Countess Paper,&#x201d; Arther said with a courtly bow. &#x201c;It is a great relief to see you well. When we heard of the attack on Angiers, we feared the worst.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Leesha said as she steadied herself. All around the courtyard, there were bows and curtsies. Leesha kept her back straight, acknowledging it all with a dignified nod that would have done Duchess Araine proud.<br><br>Then she began walking. Wonda angled herself to take the lead even as she lent her support. Close behind, two meaty Cutter women followed.<br><br>Caught off guard, the men stumbled out of their path, but they recovered swiftly, scurrying after. Gamon was the first to match her pace. &#x201c;My lady, I have prepared a roster of the house guards . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Captain Gamon.&#x201d; Leesha&#x2019;s insides were churning. She clenched her thighs, terrified her water might break before she reached the house. &#x201c;Be a dear and give it to Captain Wonda, please.&#x201d;<br><br>Gamon&#x2019;s eyes widened, and he stopped in his tracks. &#x201c;Captain Wonda?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I hereby appoint Wonda Cutter captain of my house guard,&#x201d; Leesha said loudly, continuing to walk. &#x201c;A long-overdue promotion.&#x201d;<br><br>Gamon hurried to catch back up. &#x201c;If my command has been in some way unsatisfactory . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Leesha smiled, wondering if she might vomit. &#x201c;Not at all. Your service was exemplary, and your valor on behalf of the Hollow is without question. You will retain command of the Wooden Soldiers, but my house security will report to Captain Wonda alone. Order the men to fall out and return to their duties. We&#x2019;re not expecting an attack.&#x201d;<br><br>Gamon looked like he was trying to swallow a stone, but after months in Angiers not knowing if she was captive or guest, Leesha was tired of seeing Wooden Soldiers everywhere. Wonda had already hand-selected Cutters to take over the house guard, and signaled them to secure the entrance and sweep the manse.<br><br>Arther moved quickly to take the empty place as Gamon fell back, stunned. &#x201c;The house staff . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;. . . looks crisp and ready to start the day,&#x201d; Leesha cut him off. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not keep them.&#x201d; She whisked a hand, dismissing the assemblage.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course, my lady.&#x201d; Arther gave a signal, and the crowd began to disperse. He looked ready to say more, but Leesha&#x2019;s mother pushed her way in front, Erny trailing after. Elona was six months pregnant, though she hid it well with low-cut gowns that masked her belly and drew eyes elsewhere. The men fell back like she was a coreling.<br><br>&#x201c;My daughter, Countess of the Hollow!&#x201d; Elona spread her arms, face glowing with . . . was that what pride looked like on her? It was terrifying if so.<br><br>&#x201c;Mother, Father.&#x201d; Leesha allowed each a brief embrace, trying to keep from shaking.<br><br>Elona sensed it, but she had the decency to drop her voice. &#x201c;You look terrible. What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I just need to get inside and rest.&#x201d; Leesha gave Wonda&#x2019;s arm a squeeze, and they started moving again. Others might fear to impede Elona, but Wonda was implacable as a falling tree. Elona moved to follow, but pulled up as Erny held her back. She glared at him, but like Wonda Cutter, Leesha&#x2019;s father was always on her side.<br><br>&#x201c;Welcome home, Countess.&#x201d; Rosal dipped a practiced curtsy, her mother following suit.<br><br>&#x201c;Emelia,&#x201d; Leesha said, careful to use the woman&#x2019;s proper name. &#x201c;Mrs. Lacquer. I&#x2019;m surprised to find you here at such an early hour.&#x201d;<br><br>Gared swept in, the three of them following Leesha up the steps. &#x201c;Count had the ladies staying here in his keep on account of propriety. We can find another place . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nonsense.&#x201d; Leesha winked at Rosal. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve plenty of room. How would it look for an upstanding young woman like yourself to move into the baron&#x2019;s household before the wedding? A scandal!&#x201d;<br><br>Gared blushed. &#x201c; &#x2019;Preciate it. Got some papers for you to look at when you have time . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Send them over in the morning.&#x201d; Leesha was almost to the steps now.<br><br>Inquisitor Hayes appeared next, bowing deeply. His acolyte Child Franq, usually inseparable from his master, was conspicuously absent. &#x201c;Countess. Praise be to the Creator that you are well.&#x201d;<br><br>The next carriage in line pulled up and opened its door. Hayes&#x2019; eyes widened as Tender Jona stepped out. Vika gave a cry, breaking from the receiving line to hurry down the steps to her husband.<br><br>Hayes looked at her in shock, but even shaking with pain, Leesha&#x2019;s smile was genuine. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be pleased to know, Inquisitor, that your interim assignment to the Hollow has ended. Jona will resume leading services in Hollow County.&#x201d;</p><h2>Voyage of the Liberdade</h2><p>Great mariner&#39;s thrilling, first-hand account of the wreck of his ship off the coast of South America, the 35-foot &#34;brave little craft&#34; he built from the wreckage, and its remarkable, danger-fraught voyage home. A 19th-century maritime classic brimming with courage, ingenuity, and daring.</p><p><p>Born in Nova Scotia, Canada, Joshua Slocum was the first man to sail single-handedly around the world. An international bestseller, Sailing Alone Around the World was a critical success upon its publication in 1900. Slocum enjoyed widespread fame in the English-speaking world, including an invitation to speak at a dinner in honor of Mark Twain, until his disappearance while aboard his boat the Spray in 1909. At the time, it was believed his boat had been run down by a steamer or struck by a whale, however it was later determined that the Spray could also have easily capsized. Despite a lifetime at sea, Slocum never learned to swim. He was declared legally dead in 1924.</p>Joshua Slocum is widely known for his Sailing Around the World Alone, the story of his solo circumnavigation. The Voyage of the Liberdade, his first book, is equally compelling. In it he recounts his journey to Brazil and back - he sailed down on the Aquidneck, his own ship, and returned on the Liberdade, which he built there. What happened? <p>Slocum describes sailing from port to port in Brazil, trying to take in and deliver enough cargo on the Aquidneck to make her voyage profitable. Through a series of mishaps he is saddled with a crew which turns out to be composed of brigands, not sailors: </p><p>"My pirates thought their opportunity had surely come to capture the Aquidneck, and this they undertook to do. The ringleader of the gang was a burly scoundrel, whose boast was that he had "licked both the mate and second mate of the last vessel he had sailed in, and had "busted the captain in the jaw"...Near midnight, my wife, who had heard the first footstep on deck, quietly wakened me, saying, "We must get up, and look out for ourselves! Something is going wrong on deck; the boat tackle has been let go with a great deal of noise..." My first impulse was to step on deck in the usual way, but the earnest entreaties of my wife awoke me, like, to a danger that should be investigated with caution. Arming myself therefore, with a stout carbine repeater, and eight ball cartridges in the magazine, I stepped on deck abaft instead of forward, where evidently I had been expected..." </p><p>Slocum, who landed in jail for shooting a one of the mutineers, eventually lost the Aquidneck on the reefs. Not wanting to remain a castaway in Brazil, he and his family build the Liberdade, the ship that would bring them home: </p><p>"Her dimensions being - 35 feet in length over all, 7-1/2 feet breadth of beam, and 3 feet depth of hold, who shall say that she was not large enough? Her model I got from my recollections of Cape Ann dories and from a photo of a very elegant Japanese sampan which I had before me on the spot, so, as it might be expected, when finished, she resembled both types of vessel in some degree. Her rig was the Chinese sampan style, which is, I consider, the most convenient boat rig in the whole world. This was the boat, or canoe I prefer to call it, in which we purposed to sail for North America and home. Each one had been busy during the construction and past misfortunes had all been forgotten. Madam had made the sails - and very good sails they were, too!" </p><p>Join the self-reliant and intrepid Slocum on his voyage and gain a glimpse into the romantic era that vanished when steam took over. And perhaps his book will inspire you to follow in his footsteps in your own Liberdade!</p></p><h2>Lonely Planet Discover Italy (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world&#x2019;s number one travel guide publisher*</i></p> <p><b>Lonely Planet <i>Discover Italy&nbsp;</i></b>is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

That simple observation helped establish the key principles of buoyancy that govern the flotation of hot-air balloons, boats, and denizens of the sea. &nbsp;Archimedes had a profound impact on the development of mathematics and science: from square roots to the stability of ships; number systems to levers; the value of pi to the size of the universe. Yet this same cerebral man developed machines of war that held at bay the greatest army of antiquity. Ironically, Archimedes&#x2019; reputation swelled to mythic proportions in the ancient world for his feats of engineering: the hand-cranked irrigation device&#x2014;commonly known as &#x201c;Archimedes&#x2019; screw&#x201d;&#x2014;and his ingenuous use of levers, pulleys, and ropes to launch, single-handedly, a fully laden ship! <p></p>His rediscovered treatises guided nascent thinkers out of the Dark Ages and into the Renaissance. Indeed, Archimedes&#x2019; cumulative record of achievement places him among the exalted ranks of Aristotle, Leonardo da Vinci, Isaac Newton, and Albert Einstein. <i>Eureka Man </i>brings to life for general readers the genius of Archimedes, offering succinct and understandable explanations of some of his amazing discoveries and innovations.</p><p>Alan Hirshfeld is a professor of physics at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth and an associate of the Harvard College Observatory. He is the author of <i>The Electric Life of Michael Faraday </i>and <i>Parallax: The Race to Measure the Cosmos</i>. He lives in Newton, Massachusetts."Although you may not have ever thought you needed to read a book about Archimedes, this book might leave you wondering how you got through life thus far without reading one. In this, lies Hirshfeld's rare talent. And if you have been looking for such a book, this one should have you leaping from your bathtub and heading for the door, proclaiming "Eureka -- I have found it.""&#x2014;<i>Metro West Daily News</i> <p>&#x201c;Alan Hirshfeld [cuts] through the centuries of hype surrounding this ancient genius. Against the vivid backdrop of a city under Roman siege, we're told what little is known of the life of Archimedes, and of the futuristic war machines he invented at his king's behest, which for years kept the invaders at bay. Hirshfeld explains Archimedes's mathematical achievements, from calculating pi to developing the beginnings of calculus, and traces the survival of key copies of his work through history as poetically as if they were travellers sailing to port over a stormy sea. A charming introduction to the life and legacy of an extraordinary man.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>New Scientist</i> </p><p>&#x201c;An insightful and engaging biography of the man of the legendary exclaim.&nbsp; To my surprise, Archimedes was a Newton, Edison, General Patton, and Einstein, all rolled into one: the eighth wonder of the ancient world. Alan Hirshfield provides both a delightful romp through this great man's mathematical proofs and a thrilling tale of the centuries-long search for Archimedes' greatest manuscript.&nbsp; We are introduced to a genius well worth knowing."&#x2014;Marcia Bartusiak, author of <i>The Day We Found the Universe </i>and adjunct professor of science writing at MIT</p><p>&#x201c;Naked Archimedes running down the street shouting &#x2018;Eureka!&#x2019; It's an image to chuckle over and cherish. But, oh my, there is so much more to fascinate in the tale of this astonishing man. Alan Hirshfeld has merged storytelling and science in a wonderful book that even includes a modern discovery with twists and turns of intrigue.&#x201d;&#x2014;Joy Hakim, author of <i>The Story of Science</i> and <i>A History of US</i></p><p>&#x201c;Alan Hirshfeld has given us a gripping biography of Archimedes, one of the greatest geniuses of all time.&nbsp;Even more exciting, he shows us how scholars resurrect from obscurity a person who has been dead for 2,200 years, piecing together a dramatic life from fragments of remembrance.&#x201d;&#x2014;Chet Raymo, author of <i>The Path</i></p><p>&#x201c;For this account of one of antiquity&#x2019;s most renowned mathematicians, Hirshfeld combines three elements: a biography, accessible presentations of several mathematical proofs, and a narrative of the recent recovery of long-lost texts. The last, detailed in <i>The Archimedes Codex</i> (2007), by Reviel Netz and William Noel, loses no intellectual drama in Hirshfeld&#x2019;s briefer treatment, and his work&#x2019;s clarity in the biography and math departments confirms the facility for popular science that Hirshfeld displayed in <i>Parallax </i>(2001) and <i>The Electric Life of Michael Faraday</i> (2006)... And whether or not a naked Archimedes really ran around yelling &#x2018;Eureka,&#x2019; the story&#x2019;s too good, among others, to omit from Hirshfeld&#x2019;s fine portrayal.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014; Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;University of Massachusetts Dartmouth science prof Hirshfeld offers a lively look at the work underlying Archimedes&#x2019; renown...

Readers hear, through children's own words, what it means be "in the middle" or the "keys to communication" that adults otherwise would lack. Drawing from ethnographic data and research in three immigrant communities, Marjorie Faulstich Orellana's study expands the definition of child labor by assessing children's roles as translators as part of a cost equation in an era of global restructuring and considers how sociocultural learning and development is shaped as a result of children's contributions as translators.</p><p></p></p><p>Marjorie Faulstich Orellana is an associate professor in the Graduate School of Education and Information Sciences at UCLA."<i>Translating Childhoods</i> should be required reading for educators and future teachers. It provides a refreshing and important view of children as active contributors to communities and society." (Lucinda Pease-Alvarez <i>University of California, Santa Cruz</i>)<br><br>"This is one of the most important works on learning and development among immigrant children in the last decade. Orellana integrates a cognitive and developmental focus with deeply personal portraits that expand fundamentally our understanding of what counts as generative knowledge for academic learning." (Carol D. Lee <i>Northwestern University, author of Culture, Literacy and Learning</i>)<br><br><i>"Translating Childhoods</i>, an important and pathbreaking contribution to the new sociology of childhood, provides lucid analysis and vivid ethnographic portraits of children as powerful social actors engaged in the invisible work of language brokering at home, in schools and in public spaces across an array of institutional domains where their skills matter." (Marjorie Harness Goodwin <i>UCLA</i>)<br><br>"Orellana paints a powerful portrait of the complicated lives of America's immigrant youth." (<i>Language Arts</i>)<br><br>"I&nbsp;highly recommend <i>Translating Childhoods</i> for an array of courses in language and literacy. Despite the book's strong research base, it reads more like a novel."<br> (Elaine Rubinstein-Avila <i>Anthropology and Education Quarterly</i>)<br><br>"Orellana tracks immigrant children in Los Angeles, Chicago, and a Chicago suburb to explore the work children do translating for others.

If all went well, graduates would return to join similar projects in their respective homelands. For some years, the school prospered, indeed became quite famous.&nbsp; However, when two Cherokee students courted and married local women, public resolve&#x2014;and fundamental&nbsp;ideals&#x2014;were put&nbsp;to a severe&nbsp;test.&nbsp; <br><br> <i>The Heathen School</i> follows the progress, and the demise, of this first true melting pot through the lives of individual students: among them, Henry Obookiah, a young Hawaiian who ran away from home and worked as a seaman in the China Trade before ending up in New England; John Ridge, son of a powerful Cherokee chief and subsequently a leader in the process of&nbsp;Indian &#x201c;removal&#x201d;; and Elias Boudinot, editor of the first newspaper published by and for Native Americans. From its birth as a beacon of hope for&nbsp;universal&nbsp;&#x201c;salvation,&#x201d; the heathen school descends into bitter controversy, as American racial attitudes harden and intensify. Instead of encouraging reconciliation, the school exposes the limits of tolerance and sets&nbsp;off a chain of events that will culminate tragically in the Trail of Tears.&nbsp; <br><br> In <i>The Heathen School</i>, John Demos marshals his deep empathy and feel for the textures of history to tell a moving story of families and communities&#x2014;and to probe the very roots of American identity. &nbsp;</p></p><p>John Demos is the Samuel Knight Professor Emeritus of History at Yale University.

He lives in Tyringham, MA.ï¿½ CHAPTER SEVEN ï¿½<br> &nbsp;<br> American Tragedy: Renascence and Removal<br> &nbsp;<br> Removal&#x201d; lies at the heart of the story we commonly tell about Indians in the nineteenth century. At first glance, removal and the grand project of &#x201c;civilizing&#x201d; heathen peoples appear to be opposites. Yet on the deepest level, they were joined&#x2014;were, indeed, different expressions of the same impulse. For the civilizing process imposed a complete renunciation of traditional lifeways; as such, it was another form, a cultural form, of removal. In the case of Indians, it meant essentially this: Let them become farmers instead of hunters, Christians instead of pagans, cultured in the manner of white people instead of &#x201c;savage.&#x201d; Then maybe&#x2014;just maybe&#x2014;they can be absorbed into the national mainstream. However, by the 1820s and 1830s, many whites had already given up on that possibility&#x2014;at best it seemed impractical; at worst, dangerous&#x2014; and were coming to favor actual physical removal. Just drive them out, send them far away&#x2014;across the Mississippi River at least&#x2014;and leave them entirely to themselves. (And then let us have their land.)1<br> One way or another&#x2014;through either kind of removal&#x2014;the native presence would be finished; hence the increasingly prevalent trope of &#x201c;the vanishing Indian.&#x201d; To be sure, this supposed &#x201c;vanishing&#x201d; was cause for regret, even guilt, among a certain portion of whites, mostly &#x201c;benevolent&#x201d; reformers on or near the East Coast. Farther inland, and especially among those living close to the frontier, neither regret nor guilt would be much in evidence. There, the prevalent attitude could be reduced to<br> a single phrase: Be gone! That suggests another, much sharper term&#x2014; drawn from our own twenty-first-century world&#x2014;to replace the more neutral-sounding removal. In short, &#x201c;ethnic cleansing.&#x201d;2<br> Removal&#x2014;in the straightforward sense of relocation&#x2014;had been part of American history from the settlement years onward. In its earliest phase, it was irregular, haphazard, ad hoc, and closely tied to warfare. Thus, in seventeenth-century Virginia, sporadic outbursts of violence (especially in 1622 and 1644) between white settlers and the so-called Powhatan Confederacy led to a treaty confining local Indians to a small part of the territory previously theirs. Farther north, in New England, a similar outcome followed the conclusion of the Pequot War (1637) and King Philip&#x2019;s War (1676). In Carolina, after defeat in a bloody conflict with colonists (1713), thousands of Tuscarora Indians migrated north to join the Iroquois Confederacy.3<br> As time passed, the transfer of lands and the movement of native peoples could also be accomplished peaceably, through a combination of formal purchase, negotiation, and government pressure. This was repeatedly the case, for example, in eighteenth-century Pennsylvania, where Shawnees and Delawares ceded one large tract after another, by deed or treaty, before moving on to what is now eastern Ohio. In the 1740s and 1750s, the Ohio country itself became a scene of contest between colonists and native tribes&#x2014;until the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1768) secured major Indian land cessions and established a new &#x201c;line of settlement&#x201d; roughly following the course of the Ohio River. Here, the Delaware (or Lenapi, as they originally called themselves) were directly involved once again. Indeed, the story of this particular group, spreading across many generations, was especially remarkable for serial removals. After relocating from Pennsylvania to Ohio, the Delaware would go on to Indiana (Treaty of Greenville, 1795), to Missouri (several more treaties, 1818&#x2013;26), to Kansas (1829), and finally to Oklahoma (1850s and 1860s). One might well say that removal became central to their very identity.4<br> At the start of the nineteenth century, the vast territory obtained through the Louisiana Purchase appeared to open new avenues for removal. And the process itself became more organized, more systematic, with governmental authorities&#x2014;at both federal and state levels&#x2014; increasingly in charge. Thomas Jefferson, as president and prime mover for the Purchase, was especially active this way. In 1804, Congress formally authorized him to negotiate with &#x201c;Indian tribes owning lands on the east side of the Mississippi [to] exchange lands [for] property of the United States on the west side.&#x201d;5<br> The results of such initiatives were profound. To the north, there began a complex process of relocating various tribes in the vicinity of the Great Lakes: Chippewa, Ottawa, Pottawattamie, Wyandotte, Menomenie, Winnebago, Sioux, Fox, Sac (among others). The overall direction of this movement was from the east side of the lakes (especially the Michigan Territory) to the west side (Wisconsin, which had also gained territorial status), and then to sites fully across the Mississippi. In the meantime, too, some native groups had moved to Wisconsin from much farther east&#x2014;for example, Iroquois from upstate New York, and the Stockbridge (Massachusetts) Mahicans.6<br> But it was in the Southeast that removal would have its most dramatic enactments&#x2014;and would most fully approximate ethnic cleansing. There, what were known as &#x201c;the five civilized tribes&#x201d;&#x2014;Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek, Seminole, and Cherokee&#x2014;remained relatively well entrenched into the early nineteenth century. However, a series of treaty-based land cessions, begun long before, had eaten away much of their territorial base. Then, in the 1830s, all five were subject to federally mandated relocation in the newly designated Indian Territory (what is today the state of Oklahoma). Some ten thousand Choctaws were forced from their homes in Mississippi between 1831 and 1833. The migration of the Chickasaw from southern Alabama was spread out over a longer period, roughly 1837&#x2013;50. The Creek mounted a strong resistance, but even so they were driven out (also from Alabama) during a three-year stretch, starting in 1834. The Seminole fought removal with extreme tenacity, retreating from their original settlements along the coast of Florida to its swampy interior, from where they conducted sporadic guerilla warfare against federal troops, lasting well into the 1850s. Most were eventually put to flight or killed, but enough remained to support several reservations, which are part of Florida to the present day.7<br> And then, the Cherokees&#x2014;the most famously removed group of all. Considered whole, theirs is a story of remarkable, but doomed, achievement. As such, it shadows, on a vastly grander scale, that of the Foreign Mission School&#x2014;high hopes, valiant effort, leading to eventual tragic defeat.<br> Indeed, by 1825, the Cherokees were widely considered &#x201c;the most civilized tribe in America.&#x201d; This description included both a salute to<br> all they had accomplished and the seeds of their destruction. &#x201c;Civilization&#x201d; remained the official goal. But success with the goal might under-mine other interests crucially important to whites. Success would mean accepting them, on equal terms and with equal rights. Success would mean competing with them for valuable resources. Success would mean including them as partners on the route to America&#x2019;s &#x201c;manifest destiny.&#x201d; Was the country at large ready for all that?</p><h2>Unleashing Your Inner Dog: Your Best Friend&#39;s Guide to Life</h2><p>Who hasn&#x2019;t observed the abandon and joy of being a dog?

Did you originally plan to write the story as a duet, or did the idea from <em>Sapphique</em> grow out of the experience of writing <em>Incarceron</em>?</strong></p> <p>A: Originally I thought <em>Incarceron</em> would be a stand-alone novel, but as I wrote it and it became more complex I came to realize it would not all fit in one book. So it became two. <em>Sapphique</em> carries on almost from the point the first book ends.</p> <p><strong>Q: Which of the characters from Sapphique was the most pleasure to write?</strong></p> <p>A: All the characters were fun to write. There was a new one, Rix, who I enjoyed, and Attia has more prominence in the second book. Finn is struggling with his life in the Court, so that was a new aspect, and his relationship with Claudia changes, as her doubts about him grow. The character who perhaps develops most, is Jared, who really gets to be maybe the most important person by the end. And of course there's Keiro, irrepressible as ever!</p> <p><strong>Q: What do you think makes <em>Sapphique</em> different than other dystopian novels? Do you even consider <em>Incarceron</em> and <em>Sapphique</em> dystopian books?</strong></p> <p>A: I suppose the books do take place in a world which is dystopian, but it's not a world where all hope is gone. The very end of <em>Sapphique </em>suggests that. Maybe that makes them a little different, and gives the readers a hint of cheerfulness.</p> <p><strong>Q: You have written many wonderful fantasy novels. What draws you to fantasy as a genre?</strong></p> <p>A: I like books that have the unusual in them. I like to be pleasantly puzzled when I read, and to have to work things out. Also I feel that the elements fantasy uses--magic, the supernatural, folk tales etc--serve to widen out the story and give it a universal sense. They make the book a sort of myth, where a recurring pattern is re-enacted.</p> <p><strong>Q: What do you like best about writing for teens?</strong></p> <p>A: What I like about writing for teens is that teens are so enthusiastic and positive about what they like. You get a lot of feedback, and people use the novels to make their own artwork and stories from, which is great. Also people of this age group are very open-minded and willing to suspend disbelief, which adults sometimes aren't. So I hope to go on writing for teens!</p><b>Catherine Fisher</b> is an acclaimed novelist and poet, and has written many fantasy books for young people, including the popular "Oracle Betrayed" series.

B. Morse and Thomas Edison. The electric telegraph nullified distance and shrank the world quicker and further than ever before or since, and its story mirrors and predicts that of the Internet in numerous ways.</p></p><p>Imagine an almost instantaneous communication system that would allow people and governments all over the world to send and receive messages about politics, war, illness, and family events. The government has tried and failed to control it, and its revolutionary nature is trumpeted loudly by its backers. The Internet? Nope, the humble telegraph fit this bill way back in the 1800s. The parallels between the now-ubiquitous Internet and the telegraph are amazing, offering insight into the ways new technologies can change the very fabric of society within a single generation. In <i>The Victorian Internet</i>, Tom Standage examines the history of the telegraph, beginning with a horrifically funny story of a mile-long line of monks holding a wire and getting simultaneous shocks in the interest of investigating electricity, and ending with the advent of the telephone. All the early "online" pioneers are here: Samuel Morse, Thomas Edison, and a seemingly endless parade of code-makers, entrepreneurs, and spies who helped ensure the success of this communications revolution.

We live in a world which is penetrated through and through by science and which is both whole and real. We cannot turn it into a game simply by taking sides.</i> <br> <br>&#x2014;JACOB BRONOWSKI<br> <br>In the interests of full disclosure right at the outset I must admit that I am not sympathetic to the conviction that creation requires a creator, which is at the basis of all of the world&#x2019;s religions. Every day beautiful and miraculous objects suddenly appear, from snowflakes on a cold winter morning to vibrant rainbows after a late-afternoon summer shower. Yet no one but the most ardent fundamentalists would suggest that each and every such object is lovingly and painstakingly and, most important, purposefully created by a divine intelligence. In fact, many laypeople as well as scientists revel in our ability to explain how snowflakes and rainbows can spontaneously appear, based on simple, elegant laws of physics.<br> <br>Of course, one can ask, and many do, &#x201c;Where do the laws of physics come from?&#x201d; as well as more suggestively, &#x201c;Who created these laws?&#x201d; Even if one can answer this first query, the petitioner will then often ask, &#x201c;But where did that come from?&#x201d; or &#x201c;Who created that?&#x201d; and so on.<br> <br>Ultimately, many thoughtful people are driven to the apparent need for First Cause, as Plato, Aquinas, or the modern Roman Catholic Church might put it, and thereby to suppose some divine being: a creator of all that there is, and all that there ever will be, someone or something eternal and everywhere.<br> <br>Nevertheless, the declaration of a First Cause still leaves open the question, &#x201c;Who created the creator?&#x201d; After all, what is the difference between arguing in favor of an eternally existing creator versus an eternally existing universe without one?<br> <br>These arguments always remind me of the famous story of an expert giving a lecture on the origins of the universe (sometimes identified as Bertrand Russell and sometimes William James), who is challenged by a woman who believes that the world is held up by a gigantic turtle, who is then held up by another turtle, and then another . . . with further turtles &#x201c;all the way down!&#x201d; An infinite regress of some creative force that begets itself, even some imagined force that is greater than turtles, doesn&#x2019;t get us any closer to what it is that gives rise to the universe. Nonetheless, this metaphor of an infinite regression may actually be closer to the real process by which the universe came to be than a single creator would explain.<br> <br>Defining away the question by arguing that the buck stops with God may seem to obviate the issue of infinite regression, but here I invoke my mantra: The universe is the way it is, whether we like it or not. The existence or nonexistence of a creator is independent of our desires. A world without God or purpose may seem harsh or pointless, but that alone doesn&#x2019;t require God to actually exist.<br> <br>Similarly, our minds may not be able to easily comprehend infinities (although mathematics, a product of our minds, deals with them rather nicely), but that doesn&#x2019;t tell us that infinities don&#x2019;t exist. Our universe could be infinite in spatial or temporal extent. Or, as Richard Feynman once put it, the laws of physics could be like an infinitely layered onion, with new laws becoming operational as we probe new scales. <i>We simply don&#x2019;t know!</i><br> <br>For more than two thousand years, the question, &#x201c;Why is there something rather than nothing?&#x201d; has been presented as a challenge to the proposition that our universe&#x2014;which contains the vast complex of stars, galaxies, humans, and who knows what else&#x2014;might have arisen without design, intent, or purpose. While this is usually framed as a philosophical or religious question, it is first and foremost a question about the natural world, and so the appropriate place to try and resolve it, first and foremost, is with science.<br> <br>The purpose of this book is simple. I want to show how modern science, in various guises, can address and <i>is</i> addressing the question of why there is something rather than nothing: The answers that have been obtained&#x2014;from staggeringly beautiful experimental observations, as well as from the theories that underlie much of modern physics&#x2014;all suggest that getting something from nothing is not a problem. Indeed, something from nothing may have been <i>required</i> for the universe to come into being. Moreover, all signs suggest that this is how our universe <i>could</i> have arisen.<br> <br>I stress the word <i>could</i> here, because we may never have enough empirical information to resolve this question unambiguously. But the fact that a universe from nothing is even plausible is certainly significant, at least to me.<br> <br>Before going further, I want to devote a few words to the notion of &#x201c;nothing&#x201d;&#x2014;a topic that I will return to at some length later. For I have learned that, when discussing this question in public forums, nothing upsets the philosophers and theologians who disagree with me more than the notion that I, as a scientist, do not truly understand &#x201c;nothing.&#x201d; (I am tempted to retort here that theologians are experts at nothing.)<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; they insist, is not any of the things I discuss. Nothing is &#x201c;nonbeing,&#x201d; in some vague and ill-defined sense. This reminds me of my own efforts to define &#x201c;intelligent design&#x201d; when I first began debating with creationists, of which, it became clear, there is no clear definition, except to say what it isn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;Intelligent design&#x201d; is simply a unifying umbrella for opposing evolution. Similarly, some philosophers and many theologians define and redefine &#x201c;nothing&#x201d; as not being any of the versions of nothing that scientists currently describe.<br> <br>But therein, in my opinion, lies the intellectual bankruptcy of much of theology and some of modern philosophy. For surely &#x201c;nothing&#x201d; is every bit as physical as &#x201c;something,&#x201d; especially if it is to be defined as the &#x201c;absence of something.&#x201d; It then behooves us to understand precisely the physical nature of both these quantities. And without science, any definition is just words.<br> <br>A century ago, had one described &#x201c;nothing&#x201d; as referring to purely empty space, possessing no real material entity, this might have received little argument. But the results of the past century have taught us that empty space is in fact far from the inviolate nothingness that we presupposed before we learned more about how nature works. Now, I am told by religious critics that I cannot refer to empty space as &#x201c;nothing,&#x201d; but rather as a &#x201c;quantum vacuum,&#x201d; to distinguish it from the philosopher&#x2019;s or theologian&#x2019;s idealized &#x201c;nothing.&#x201d;<br> <br>So be it. But what if we are then willing to describe &#x201c;nothing&#x201d; as the absence of space and time itself? Is this sufficient? Again, I suspect it would have been . . . at one time. But, as I shall describe, we have learned that space and time can themselves spontaneously appear, so now we are told that even this &#x201c;nothing&#x201d; is not really the nothing that matters. And we&#x2019;re told that the escape from the &#x201c;real&#x201d; nothing requires divinity, with &#x201c;nothing&#x201d; thus defined by fiat to be &#x201c;that from which only God can create something.&#x201d;<br> <br>It has also been suggested by various individuals with whom I have debated the issue that, if there is the &#x201c;potential&#x201d; to create something, then that is not a state of true nothingness. And surely having laws of nature that give such potential takes us away from the true realm of nonbeing. But then, if I argue that perhaps the laws themselves also arose spontaneously, as I shall describe might be the case, then that too is not good enough, because whatever system in which the laws may have arisen is not true nothingness.<br> <br>Turtles all the way down? I don&#x2019;t believe so. But the turtles are appealing because science is changing the playing field in ways that make people uncomfortable. Of course, that is one of the purposes of science (one might have said &#x201c;natural philosophy&#x201d; in Socratic times). Lack of comfort means we are on the threshold of new insights. Surely, invoking &#x201c;God&#x201d; to avoid difficult questions of &#x201c;how&#x201d; is merely intellectually lazy. After all, if there were no potential for creation, then God couldn&#x2019;t have created anything. It would be semantic hocus-pocus to assert that the potentially infinite regression is avoided because God exists outside nature and, therefore, the &#x201c;potential&#x201d; for existence itself is not a part of the nothingness from which existence arose.<br> <br>My real purpose here is to demonstrate that in fact science <i>has</i> changed the playing field, so that these abstract and useless debates about the nature of nothingness have been replaced by useful, operational efforts to describe how our universe might actually have originated. I will also explain the possible implications of this for our present and future.<br> <br>This reflects a very important fact. When it comes to understanding how our universe evolves, religion and theology have been at best irrelevant. They often muddy the waters, for example, by focusing on questions of nothingness without providing any definition of the term based on empirical evidence. While we do not yet fully understand the origin of our universe, there is no reason to expect things to change in this regard. Moreover, I expect that ultimately the same will be true for our understanding of areas that religion now considers its own territory, such as human morality.<br> <br>Science has been effective at furthering our understanding of nature because the scientific ethos is based on three key principles: (1) follow the evidence wherever it leads; (2) if one has a theory, one needs to be willing to try to prove it wrong as much as one tries to prove that it is right; (3) the ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment, not the comfort one derives from one&#x2019;s a priori beliefs, nor the beauty or elegance one ascribes to one&#x2019;s theoretical models.<br> <br>The results of experiments that I will describe here are not only timely, they are also unexpected. The tapestry that science weaves in describing the evolution of our universe is far richer and far more fascinating than any revelatory images or imaginative stories that humans have concocted. Nature comes up with surprises that far exceed those that the human imagination can generate.<br> <br>Over the past two decades, an exciting series of developments in cosmology, particle theory, and gravitation have completely changed the way we view the universe, with startling and profound implications for our understanding of its origins as well as its future. Nothing could therefore not be more interesting to write about, if you can forgive the pun.<br> <br>The true inspiration for this book comes not so much from a desire to dispel myths or attack beliefs, as from my desire to celebrate knowledge and, along with it, the absolutely surprising and fascinating universe that ours has turned out to be.<br> <br>Our search will take us on a whirlwind tour to the farthest reaches of our expanding universe, from the earliest moments of the Big Bang to the far future, and will include perhaps the most surprising discovery in physics in the past century.<br> <br>Indeed, the immediate motivation for writing this book now is a profound discovery about the universe that has driven my own scientific research for most of the past three decades and that has resulted in the startling conclusion that most of the energy in the universe resides in some mysterious, now inexplicable form permeating all of empty space. It is not an understatement to say that this discovery has changed the playing field of modern cosmology.<br> <br>For one thing, this discovery has produced remarkable new support for the idea that our universe arose from precisely nothing. It has also provoked us to rethink both a host of assumptions about the processes that might govern its evolution and, ultimately, the question of whether the very laws of nature are truly fundamental. Each of these, in its own turn, now tends to make the question of why there is something rather than nothing appear less imposing, if not completely facile, as I hope to describe.<br> <br>The direct genesis of this book hearkens back to October of 2009, when I delivered a lecture in Los Angeles with the same title. Much to my surprise, the YouTube video of the lecture, made available by the Richard Dawkins Foundation, has since become something of a sensation, with nearly a million viewings as of this writing, and numerous copies of parts of it being used by both the atheist and theist communities in their debates.<br> <br>Because of the clear interest in this subject, and also as a result of some of the confusing commentary on the web and in various media following my lecture, I thought it worth producing a more complete rendition of the ideas that I had expressed there in this book. Here I can also take the opportunity to add to the arguments I presented at the time, which focused almost completely on the recent revolutions in cosmology that have changed our picture of the universe, associated with the discovery of the energy and geometry of space, and which I discuss in the first two-thirds of this book.<br> <br>In the intervening period, I have thought a lot more about the many antecedents and ideas constituting my argument; I&#x2019;ve discussed it with others who reacted with a kind of enthusiasm that was infectious; and I&#x2019;ve explored in more depth the impact of developments in particle physics, in particular, on the issue of the origin and nature of our universe. And finally, I have exposed some of my arguments to those who vehemently oppose them, and in so doing have gained some insights that have helped me develop my arguments further.<br> <br>While fleshing out the ideas I have ultimately tried to describe here, I benefitted tremendously from discussions with some of my most thoughtful physics colleagues. In particular I wanted to thank Alan Guth and Frank Wilczek for taking the time to have extended discussions and correspondence with me, resolving some confusions in my own mind and in certain cases helping reinforce my own interpretations.<br> <br>Emboldened by the interest of Leslie Meredith and Dominick Anfuso at Free Press, Simon &amp; Schuster, in the possibility of a book on this subject, I then contacted my friend Christopher Hitchens, who, besides being one of the most literate and brilliant individuals I know, had himself been able to use some of the arguments from my lecture in his remarkable series of debates on science and religion. Christopher, in spite of his ill health, kindly, generously, and bravely agreed to write a foreword. For that act of friendship and trust, I will be eternally grateful. Unfortunately, Christopher&#x2019;s illness eventually overwhelmed him to the extent that completing the foreword became impossible, in spite of his best efforts. Nevertheless, in an embarrassment of riches, my eloquent, brilliant friend, the renowned scientist and writer Richard Dawkins, had earlier agreed to write an afterword. After my first draft was completed, he then proceeded to produce something in short order whose beauty and clarity was astounding, and at the same time humbling. I remain in awe. To Christopher, Richard, then, and all of those above, I issue my thanks for their support and encouragement, and for motivating me to once again return to my computer and write.<br> <br>ï¿½ 2012 Lawrence M.

A devoted mother to her son, Deryk, she identifies herself as "her kid's mom" because that's her most important job.</p><p>Never one to shy away from tough truths, Dr. Laura marshalls compelling evidence for the widespread neglect of America's children and convincingly condemns the numerous rationalizations to excuse it. Parents, special interest groups, and professionals in education and psychology all contribute to a dangerous trend that places adult fulfillment above obligation to children. <em>Parenthood by Proxy</em> addresses the serious causes and effects of this national crisis, among them the high rate of divorce, serial marriages, single parenting, the premature sexualization of children, dual-career families, disdain for religion, the redefinition of immoral behavior as lifestyle choices, and societal intolerance for the concept of judgment.</p><p>In <em>Parenthood by Proxy</em>, Dr. Laura exhorts parents to make their own children their top priority and, if necessary, to change their lives to do so. In her inimitable, straight-shooting style, Dr. Laura entreats parents to involve themselves in their children's hearts, minds, and souls, to cherish and protect them, and to commit to the essential task of teaching them right from wrong. She acknowledges that parents no longer get much support from neighbors or public and private institutions, but she urges mothers and fathers to work even harder to counteract the prevailing culture of selfishness and irresponsibility.</p><p><em>Parenthood by Proxy</em> covers all aspects of parenting, from childbearing to discipline, from multiple families to being role models. Dr. Laura also tackles such cultural and societal concerns as abortion, modern sexuality, drug and alcohol use, violence, discipline, and a child's right to privacy.</p><p><em>Parenthood by Proxy</em> is a passionate and provocative summation of the perils of parenting and a road map to safety for America's families.</p></p><p><p>Dr. Laura Schlessinger, a licensed marriage and family therapist, is one of the most popular talk-show hosts in radio history and the only woman to win the prestigious Marconi Award for syndicated radio. She is the author of twelve <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers, writes a daily blog, and is a regular <em>Newsmax</em> columnist. She is heard daily on Sirius/XM Channel 155 live, and her program is streamed and podcast on www.drlaura.com. Dr. Schlessinger has her own YouTube Channel (YouTube.com/drlaura). She is also the skipper and driver of a racing sailboat program that won the 2010 international race from Newport Beach to Cabo San Lucas. She and her husband live in Southern California.</p>Sociologist and controversial radio talk show host "Dr. Laura" sends a clear message: parenting should be limited to traditional families of two parents, one of whom stays home with the children. Divorced or single people, homosexuals, and couples who both work should not have children; those who do are self-centered and contribute to the moral decline of society. Daycare users and providers, psychologists, abortion rights supporters, fertility specialists, and the American Library Association are just a few other targets of Dr. Laura's anger (and her epilog informs readers that her book is indeed written out of anger toward those who disagree with her). While many public libraries will want to buy this book to provide a different viewpoint and because Dr. Laura is well known, this reviewer does not think that Parenthood by Proxy has any place in any caring and considerate dialog on child rearing. Such a book promotes a climate of intolerance and hate. To belittle and negate the efforts of many caring parents from a wide variety of lifestyles who are raising moral, happy, and achieving children does not contribute to our understanding of parenthood.

Yet, we walk away or turn our heads when we see another officer doing something that could end their career, their marriage, or their freedom. Because we don&#39;t rat on another peace officer. AS OFFICERS we have taken an oath to protect and serve the public and each other. Yet, the number of officers that commit suicide is much greater than the number of officers killed by felons. Some of those suicides are the result of being under investigation for crimes or unethical behavior. Behavior that other cops were aware of and never reported, and did nothing to stop, because we don&#39;t rat on other cops. AS DEPUTIES, we have sworn to protect those in our custody. Yet some of us will go to prison every year because of acts that could have, and should have, been stopped by other deputies because we don&#39;t rat on other deputies. AS TROOPERS, we have sworn to protect and serve by keeping our highways safe. Yet some of us will die in traffic accidents because we drive too fast for all the wrong reasons and some of us will be stopped, but not arrested, for drunk driving because we don&#39;t rat on other troopers. AS SPECIAL AGENTS, we have sworn to uphold the constitution. Yet some of us will go to prison this year because we did nothing when we saw other agents involved in criminal or unethical behavior because we don&#39;t rat on other agents. AS GUARDS, we protect each other against men and women convicted of the most heinous crimes. But we will ignore unethical or even criminal conduct of other guards. Because we don&#39;t rat on other guards. There is a code of silence in the criminal justice system that infects all levels, and the cost in lives destroyed or lost is enormous. It is not an infection we can cure, but it is an infection we can fight, by making a commitment to protect each other against ourselves as well as others. Michael W. Quinn</p><p>Mike Quinn has been in law enforcement for 25 years, 23 1/2 of those with the Minneapolis Police Department and 18 months with the Minnesota Police Corps where he oversaw the design and development of the federally sponsored Police Corps Academy. <p>During his tenure with the Force Mike worked in some of the toughest and highest-profile units, serving over 300 high- risk warrants without a critical incident, conducting successful raids on armed and dangerous suspects, and diligently investigating allegations of internal criminal and departmental violations. </p><p>He is the recipient of numerous awards, including departmental Commendations, Awards of Merit, and a Unit Citation; an Outstanding Service Award from the FBI, a Leadership award from the Urban League, two Meritorious Masts from the United States Marine Corps, and the Lifetime Achievement in Law Enforcement Training award from the Association of Training of Officers of Minnesota. He is an acknowledged contributor to The Tactical Edge by Calibre Press and he regularly teaches and has testified as an expert witness on such topics as Self Defense for Civilians, Search and Seizure, Firearms, Rappelling, Defensive Tactics, Pressure Point Control Tactics, Deadly Force, Chemical Agents, High Risk Warrants and SWAT Tactics. </p><p>Mike was a member of the Emergency Response Unit for 17 years and was part of the joint FBI/Minneapolis Police SWAT team for 8 years. An active member of the Hibbing Community College Law Enforcement Advisory Board, Mike is still trying to make a difference in police training. A lifelong resident of Minneapolis, Mike lives with his wife of 30 plus years, with whom he shares a love for distance running, mountain biking, and the great outdoors. </p><p>Mike's success in law enforcement is reflected in the passion and commitment he brings to being an ethical cop. Walking with the Devil is another example of this commitment.</p>I firmly believe that Mike Quinn s book should be mandatory reading for all recruits attending a police academy and on the International Association of Chiefs of Police professional development reading list. Whenever the opportunity presents itself I give this as a gift to young people as they prepare to start their career in Law Enforcement. --Richard Thomas, Chief of Police, Port Washington, Wisconsin and former Educational Consultant for the State of Wisconsin, Department of Justice, Training and Standards Bureau<br><br>Quinn s book reveals what really goes on behind the scenes. I learned stuff I never knew, including about one case I handled in the grand jury. Quinn describes police falsifying reports, committing perjury, and covering these acts by the Code of Silence. It's cover your partner's ass, because next time you may need the partner to cover yours. When Quinn saw misconduct, he went to superiors, first line supervising sergeants, lieutenants, and even deputy chiefs, getting no satisfaction. So, what s so important about this book? Itis that every judge should read it and understand the pressures and motivation that foster the police misconduct that defense lawyers seeevery day. Let s face it, these judges are incredibly naï¿½ve about police misconduct. They think the police tell the truth and defendants lie. When I was a third year law student doing a prosecutorial internship I was assigned a marijuana possession case. The defendantwas arrested in his living room and the police found the pot in the bedroom. This was just after the Supreme Court decided Chimel v. California in which the court said a search incident was limited to the arrestee's arm s reach. When I told this to the cop who seized the evidence, he said, Well, then, I found the pot in the living room. Needless to say I was shocked at his readiness to commit perjury and dismissed the case. Quinn details case after case of this sort of thing. Quinn makes the point that one cop can make a difference. He cites examples in which misbehaving police were told by coworkers to stop. The misconduct would stop in front of the complainant. Color me cynical, but who knows what happened elsewhere. Read this book and pass it on to the bench. It is a rare glimpse at a world that is indeed shrouded in the Code of Silence. --John C. Brink, Attorney Former Hennepin County Prosecutor, 2003-2010 Super Lawyer<br><br>Quinn challenges ethical officers with a simple, practical strategy for confronting an unethical environment. Walking With the Devil instills a sense of hope for cracking the blue code of silence. I recently referenced Quinn's concepts as I taught police ethics to the command staff of a police agency in a developing country. Without a doubt, Quinn's message is universal. A powerful read for those who believe in the ethical obligations of the police. --Chief Frank Kaminski (ret) Evanston, Illinois Police Department</p><h2>Simone Weil and The Suffering of Love</h2><p>Simone Weil is one of the few spiritual thinkers to give an adequate account for the place of suffering in our world. We traditionally view suffering as that which thwarts our most profound longings and happiness. Simone Weil insists that suffering is not a problem to overcome. Suffering, as it arises in the sacrifices of divine and human love is a fact of life, neither to be rejected nor invited, but also something that can shape human life by opening itself to the divine love. Here again is Springsted&#39;s comprehensive treatment of Simone Weil&#39;s religious insights, unique is her understanding of the scientific modern age without cynicism, meanwhile embracing much of traditional Christian spirituality without naivete. In her unusual approach that is new and yet draws on ancient thought, Weil supports a radical theology, insisting that the oppressed - with whom she identified - are not assisted by a transfer of power, but they must, like those in power, view suffering as a way of overcoming the human penchant for self-centeredness, and as a way of drawing closer to the world in love and as a whole.</p><p></p><h2>One Square Inch of Silence: One Man&#39;s Search for Natural Silence in a Noisy World (with CD)</h2><p>An Emmy Award-winning acoustic ecologist presents a call to arms against human-created noise, arguing that natural quiet is key to human and environmental health and should be added to the world&#39;s ecological agenda, in a volume that is complemented by CD recordings of natural soundscapes.</p><p><b>Gordon Hempton</b> is an acoustic ecologist and Emmy Award-winning sound recordist.&nbsp; For nearly 25 years he has provided professional audio services to musicians, galleries, museums, and media producers, including Microsoft, Smithsonian, National Geographic, Discovery, National Public Radio, and numerous other businesses and organizations.

Why should we preserve silence? Because the words peace and quiet go together for profound reasons. And because machine noise is driving other species, from songbirds to marine life, into extinction by creating deadly stress and interfering with communication. After traveling the world and finding that nearly no place is free of human-generated noise, Hempton decided to take a stand in one of the last quiet spots, the Hoh Rain Forest deep in Olympic National Park, declaring &#x201c;one square inch&#x201d; of silence in the hope that from this nucleus quiet would spread. To spread the word about his project, Hempton set out, sound-level meter in hand, to &#x201c;take the sonic pulse of America.&#x201d; With the assistance of writer Grossmann, Hempton interweaves his intriguing and instructive on-the-road adventures with fascinating and rarely addressed facts about sound, health, and the environment.

The book reaches beyond the commonplace to give profound new insights into the nature of the life to come. <p>This book examines eyewitness accounts of more than 200 individuals who have ventured into the spirit world and have then returned to tell of their experiences. It also draws extensively from the scriptures and from the discourses of Latter-day Saint leaders. As the evidence of these accounts is analyzed, numerous new understandings are revealed to the reader. Within these pages are vivid descriptions of spirit-world conditions including buildings, landscaping, wearing apparel, organization, occupations, and Church callings. Many instructive descriptions of the amazing capabilities of spirit beings are provided. Of special interest are the vivid descriptions of Jesus Christ as He has appeared to many who have entered into Paradise. The numerous roles of spirit beings who visit the earth, as Gardian Angels and in other capacities, are described in detail. The factors which govern man's time of death are discussed, and the nature of man's "new birth" into the next life is desc! ribed in detail by those who have experienced it. </p><p>Life Everlasting peers into the spirit prison and hell and reports conditions in those environments. Then it sweeps forward in time to analyze the nature of the resurrections and final judgment. A careful consideration of the final rewards available to man is made, with detailed and spcific coverage of the fate of the sons of perdition and the destinies of the inhabitants of the telestial, terrestrial and celestial kingdoms. The final chapter is a penetrating explanation of the nature of godhood and exaltation. </p><p>Few books have ever combined such a wealth of now concepts and interesting information with the careful presentation, documentation and scholarship of Life Everlasting. Latter-day Saints will find strong evidences which confirm their beliefs in the afterlife. Others, no matter what their religious oriention, will find Life Everlasting to be one of the most far-reaching, comprehensive presentations of life-after-death experiences in print. It is inevitable that this book will continue to be widely read and discussed for many years to come.</p></p><p>Duane S.

With the numerous reports from near-death experiences, they give one hope and assurance that when we die, life in Paradise will be a life one might even look forward to and not have fear of the unknown. --Amazon<br><br>For members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints this book is something you should add to your library of Church books. You can tell Crowther has extensively studied Church history and thought deeply about the subject of each chapter. His research upholds what is taught by the Church but it goes into deeper detail with examples of member experiences. This book has enabled me to think more deeply about spiritual things and has added to my knowledge of things I know to be true. I enjoyed the numerous stories of dreams and visions of early members of the Church. Actually, many of the stories told are from members living in the early part of the 20th century also. Some stories are from the leaders of the Church but many are from the "average" members with strong testimonies. I was very touched by many of the stories. For people not of the Latter-Day Saint faith, it may be overwhelming with all the references to our core beliefs and extra details. It's best to already believe in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ before reading this book. The book is actually written to further the testimony and knowledge of a Latter-Day Saint member. --Amazon<br><br>So much interesting information...it's a good idea to study the scriptures (specifically the Book of Mormon) before your sessions of studying this...otherwise it's too easy to get overwhelmed and confused. Having the spirit to guide is a MUST. There were times when it felt like my head was going to explode trying to comprehend some of the subject matter, but after a few weeks of pondering and praying about it, it started to make sense and has had a profound positive impact on my perspective of life and the world around me. This wouldn't happen by just reading the book...the guidance of the Holy Spirit is crucial. --Amazon</p><h2>WINTER WITH THE MOODYS (MOODYS, NO 3)</h2><p>This is a fun book to read for the whole family.</p><p></p><h2>Descubre, Level 1, Teacher&#39;s Annotated Edition</h2><p>PRISTINE.

Emmaline Troy wound around fire-eaters, pickpockets, and chanteurs de rue. She meandered through the tribes of black-clad Goths who swarmed Notre Dame like it was the Gothic mother ship calling them home. And still she attracted attention.<br> <br>The human males she passed turned their heads slowly to regard her, frowns in place, sensing something, but unsure. Probably some genetic memory from long ago that signaled her as their wildest fantasy or their darkest nightmare.<br> <br>Emma was neither.<br> <br>She was a co-ed&#x2014;a recent Tulane grad&#x2014;alone in Paris and hungry. Weary from another failed search for blood, she sank onto a rustic bench beneath a chestnut tree, eyes riveted to a waitress drawing espresso at a cafï¿½. If only blood poured so easily, Emma thought. Yes, if it came warm and rich from a bottomless tap, then her stomach wouldn&#x2019;t be clenched in hunger at the mere idea.<br> <br>Starving in Paris. And friendless. Was there ever such a predicament?<br> <br>Couples strolling hand in hand along the gravel walk seemed to mock her loneliness. Was it just her, or did lovers look more adoringly at each other in this city? Especially in the springtime. Die, bastards.<br> <br>She sighed. It wasn&#x2019;t their fault that they were bastards who should die.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d been spurred to enter this fray by the prospect of her echoing hotel room and the idea that she might find another blood pusher in the City of Light. Her former hookup had gone south&#x2014;literally&#x2014;fleeing Paris for Ibiza. He&#x2019;d given little explanation for abandoning his job, saying only that with the &#x201c;arrival of the risen king,&#x201d; some &#x201c;serious epic shit&#x201d; was brewing in &#x201c;gay Paree.&#x201d; Whatever that meant.<br> <br>As a vampire, she was a member of the Lore, that stratum of beings who&#x2019;d convinced humans they existed only in imagination. Yet though the Lore was thick here, Emma had been unable to replace her pusher. Any creatures she could scout out to ask fled her solely because she was a vampire. They scurried without knowing that she wasn&#x2019;t even a full-blooded one, nor that Emma was a wuss who&#x2019;d never bitten another living being. As her fierce adoptive aunts loved to tell everyone, &#x201c;Emma cries her pink tears if she dusts a moth&#x2019;s wings.&#x201d;<br> <br>Emma had accomplished nothing during this trip that she&#x2019;d insisted on taking. Her quest to uncover information about her deceased parents&#x2014;her Valkyrie mother and her unknown vampire father&#x2014;was a failure. A failure that would culminate in a call to her aunts to get them to retrieve her. Because she couldn&#x2019;t feed herself. Pitiful. She sighed. She&#x2019;d be razzed about this for another seventy years&#x2014;<br> <br>She heard a crash, and before she even had time to feel bad for the waitress getting docked, another crash and then another followed. She tilted her head in curiosity&#x2014;just as a table umbrella across the walk shot fifteen feet up to be batted high in the sky, fluttering all the way to the Seine. A cruise boat honked and Gallic curses erupted.<br> <br>Half-lit by the walk&#x2019;s torchlights, a towering man turned over cafï¿½ tables, artists&#x2019; easels, and book stands selling century-old pornography. Tourists screamed and fled in the wake of destruction. Emma shot to her feet with a gasp, looping her satchel over her shoulder.<br> <br>He was cutting a path directly to her, his black trench coat trailing behind him. His size and his unnaturally fluid movements made her wonder if he could possibly be human. His hair was thick and long, concealing half his face, and several days&#x2019; growth of beard shadowed his jaw.<br> <br>He pointed a shaking hand at her. &#x201c;You,&#x201d; he growled.<br> <br>She jerked glances over both of her shoulders looking for the unfortunate you he was addressing. Her. Holy shite, this madman had settled on her.<br> <br>He turned his palm up and beckoned her to come to him&#x2014;as if he was confident she would.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh, I-I don&#x2019;t know you,&#x201d; she squeaked, trying to back up, but her legs immediately met the bench.<br> <br>He continued stalking her, ignoring the tables between them, tossing them aside like toys instead of varying his direct pursuit of her. Furious intent burned in his pale blue eyes. She could sense his rage more sharply as he neared, unsettling her, because her kind were considered the predators in the night&#x2014;never the prey. And because, at heart, she was a coward.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come.&#x201d; He bit out the word as though with difficulty and motioned for her again.<br> <br>Eyes wide, she shook her head, then leapt backward over the bench, twisting in the air. She landed facing away from him and began speeding down the quay. She was weak, more than two days without blood, but terror made her quick as she crossed the Archevï¿½chï¿½ Bridge to exit the island.<br> <br>Three&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. four blocks covered. She chanced a look behind her. Didn&#x2019;t see him. Had she lost him&#x2014;? Sudden glaring music from her purse made her cry out.<br> <br>Who in the hell had programmed the Crazy Frog ring tone into her cell phone? Her eyes narrowed. Aunt Regin. The world&#x2019;s most immature immortal, who looked like a siren and behaved like a frat pledge.<br> <br>Cell phones in their coven were for dire emergency only. Ringers would disturb their hunting in the back alleys of New Orleans, and even a vibration would be enough to trigger a twitching ear in a low creature.<br> <br>She flipped it open. Speak of the devil: Regin the Radiant.<br> <br>&#x201c;Little busy right now,&#x201d; Emma snapped, taking another peek over her shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;Drop your things. Don&#x2019;t take time to pack. Annika wants you at the executive airport immediately. You&#x2019;re in danger.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Duh.&#x201d;<br> <br>Click. That wasn&#x2019;t a warning&#x2014;that was narration.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d ask the details once she was on the plane. As if she&#x2019;d needed a reason to return home. Just the mention of danger and she would scamper back to her coven, to her Valkyrie aunts who would kill anything that threatened her and keep malice at bay.<br> <br>As she tried to remember her way to the airport where she&#x2019;d landed, the rain started to fall, warm and light at first&#x2014;April lovers still laughing as they ran under awnings&#x2014;but swiftly turning to pounding cold. She came to a crowded avenue, feeling safer as she wound through traffic. She dodged cars with their wipers and horns going full-force. She didn&#x2019;t see her pursuer.<br> <br>With only the satchel slung around her neck, she traveled quickly, miles passing beneath her feet before she spied an open park and then the airfield just beyond it. She could see the diffused air around the jet engines as they warmed, could see the shades on every window already drawn tight. Almost there.<br> <br>Emma convinced herself she&#x2019;d lost him, because she was fast. She was also adept at convincing herself of things that might not be&#x2014;good at pretending. She could pretend she took classes at night by choice, and that blushing didn&#x2019;t make her thirsty&#x2014;<br> <br>A vicious growl sounded. Her eyes widened, but she didn&#x2019;t turn back, just sprinted across the field. She felt claws sink into her ankle a second before she was dragged to the muddy ground and thrown onto her back. A hand covered her mouth, though she&#x2019;d been trained not to scream.<br> <br>&#x201c;Never run from one such as me.&#x201d; Her attacker didn&#x2019;t sound human. &#x201c;You will no&#x2019; get away. And we like it.&#x201d; His voice was guttural like a beast&#x2019;s, breaking, yet his accent was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Scottish?<br> <br>As she peered up at him through the rain, he examined her with eyes that were golden in color one moment, then flickering that eerie blue the next. No, not human.<br> <br>Up close, she could see his features were even, masculine. A strong chin and jaw complemented the chiseled planes. He was beautiful, so much so that she thought he had to be a fallen angel. Possible. How could she rule out anything?<br> <br>The hand that had been covering her mouth roughly grasped her chin. He narrowed his eyes, focusing on her lips&#x2014;on her barely noticeable fangs. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he choked out. &#x201c;No&#x2019; possible&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He yanked her head side to side, running his face down her neck, smelling her, then growled in fury, &#x201c;Goddamn you.&#x201d;<br> <br>When his eyes turned blue sharply, she cried out, her breath seeming to leave her body.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you trace?&#x201d; he grated as though speech was difficult. &#x201c;Answer me!&#x201d;<br> <br>She shook her head, uncomprehending. Tracing was how vampires teleported, disappearing and reappearing in thin air. Then he knows I&#x2019;m a vampire?<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;N-no.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d never been strong or skilled enough. &#x201c;Please.&#x201d; She blinked against the rain, pleading with her eyes. &#x201c;You have the wrong woman.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Think I&#x2019;d know you. Make sure, if you insist.&#x201d; He raised a hand&#x2014;to touch her? Strike her? She fought, hissing desperately.<br> <br>A callused palm grasped the back of her neck, his other hand clenching her wrists as he bent down to her neck. Her body jerked from the feel of his tongue against her skin. His mouth was hot in the chill, wet air, making her shudder until her muscles knotted. He groaned while kissing her, his hand squeezing her wrists hard. Below her skirt, drops of rain tracked down her thighs, shocking her with cold.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do this! Please&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; When her last word ended with a whimper, he seemed to come out of a trance, his brows drawing together as his eyes met hers, but he didn&#x2019;t release her hands.<br> <br>He flicked his claw down her blouse and sliced it and the flimsy bra beneath open, then slowly brushed the halves past her breasts. She struggled, but it was useless against his strength. He studied her with a greedy gaze as rain splattered down, stinging her naked breasts. She was shivering uncontrollably.<br> <br>His pain was so sharp it nauseated her. He could take her or he could tear open her unprotected belly and kill her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Instead he ripped open his own shirt, then placed his huge palms against her back to draw her to his chest. He groaned when their skin touched, and electricity seemed to flash through her. Lightning split the sky.<br> <br>He rumbled foreign words against her ear. She felt they were&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tender words, making her think she&#x2019;d lost her mind. She went limp, her arms hanging while he shuddered against her, his lips so hot in the pouring rain as he ran them down her neck, across her face, even brushing them over her eyelids. There he knelt, clutching her; there she lay, boneless and dazed, as she watched the lightning slash above them.<br> <br>His hand cradled the back of her head as he moved her to face him.<br> <br>He seemed torn as he watched her with some fierce emotion&#x2014;she&#x2019;d never been looked at so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. consumingly. Confusion overwhelmed her. Would he attack or let her go? Let me go&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>A tear slipped down her face, warmth streaking down amidst the drops of rain.<br> <br>The look disappeared. &#x201c;Blood for tears?&#x201d; he roared, clearly revolted by her pink tears. He turned away as if he couldn&#x2019;t stand to look upon her, then blindly swatted at her shirt to close it. &#x201c;Take me to your home, vampire.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I-I don&#x2019;t live here,&#x201d; she said in a strangled tone, staggered by what had just occurred, and by the fact that he knew what she was.<br> <br>&#x201c;Take me to where you stay,&#x201d; he ordered, finally facing her as he stood before her.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she amazed herself by saying.<br> <br>He, too, looked surprised. &#x201c;Because you doona want me to stop? Good. I&#x2019;ll take you here on the grass on your hands and knees&#x201d;&#x2014;he lifted her easily until she was kneeling&#x2014;&#x201c;till well after the sun rises.&#x201d;<br> <br>He must have seen her resignation because he hauled her to her feet and pushed at her to get her moving. &#x201c;Who stays with you?&#x201d;<br> <br>My husband, she wanted to snap. The linebacker who&#x2019;s going to kick your ass. Yet she couldn&#x2019;t lie, even now, and never would have had the nerve to provoke him anyway. &#x201c;I am alone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your man lets you travel by yourself?&#x201d; he asked over the downpour. His voice was beginning to sound human again. When she didn&#x2019;t answer, he said with a sneer, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve a careless male for yourself. His loss.&#x201d;<br> <br>She stumbled in a pothole and he gently steadied her, then seemed angry with himself that he&#x2019;d helped her. But when he led them in front of a car a moment later, he threw her out of the way, leaping back at the sound of the horn. He swiped at the side of the car, claws crumpling the metal like tinfoil, sending it skidding. When it finally stopped, the engine block dropped to the street with a thud. The driver threw open the door, dived for the street, then darted away.<br> <br>Mouth open in shock, she frantically scrambled backward, realizing her captor looked as though he&#x2019;d&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. never seen a car.<br> <br>He crossed to her, looming over her. In a low, deadly tone, he grated, &#x201c;I only hope you run from me again.&#x201d;<br> <br>He snatched her hand and again lifted her to her feet. &#x201c;How much farther?&#x201d;<br> <br>With a limp finger, she pointed out the Crillon on Place de la Concorde.<br> <br>He gave her a look of pure hatred. &#x201c;Your kind always had money.&#x201d; His tone was scathing. &#x201c;Nothing&#x2019;s changed.&#x201d; He knew she was a vampire. Did he know who or what her aunts were? He must&#x2014;otherwise how could Regin have known to warn her about him? How could he know her coven was well-off?<br> <br>After ten minutes of her being dragged across avenues, they pushed past the doorman of the hotel, garnering stares as they entered the palatial lobby. At least the lights were dimmed.

S. Eliot Prize for Poetry, and she is the winner of the Poetry Center Book Award, the California Book Award, and fellowships from the Academy of American Poets, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Guggenheim and Rockefeller foundations. Her work has appeared in <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, <em>The Nation</em>, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, and multiple volumes of <em>The Best American Poetry</em> and <em>Pushcart Prize</em> anthologies.</p>Celebrated as an anthologist (Women in Praise of the Sacred, etc.), Hirshfeld seeks wisdom in the introspective occasions everyday life provides for this fifth collection. As in The October Palace, Hirshfeld's stripped-down diction and hushed sentences attend to her speaker's psychic losses and transformations: "For a year I watched/ as something--terror? happiness? grief?--/ entered and then left my body." "Dream Notebook" wrests a new-seeming subject from an old lyric quarry--not our dreams, but the way we forget them--while other poems consider household objects ("Pillow," "Ladder") in novel ways. Hirshfeld, who has also published a prose work on religion and poetry, uses Buddhism to inform a number of moving, straightforward lyrics and verse-essays (on "Clocks," "Ink," and "Sleep"). Elsewhere poems appeal to autobiography ("I, a woman of forty-five, beginning to gray at the temples") or take up, along with the speaker's overt self-consciousness, the powers and limits of poetry: "Does a poem enlarge the world,/ or only our idea of the world?"; "Why is it so difficult to speak simply?" A few such questions can go a long way, and Hirshfeld relies on their diffuse power too often: this long book of short poems might have been better shorter. A more serious flaw is Hirshfeld's dependence on Louise Gl ck's characteristic modes: the chilly, interior inquiries and flat declarations will seem very, very familiar to the latter's readers. Yet if Hirshfeld rarely surpasses her model, she uses it well: always accessible and on occasion profound, her new work will likely add to her large circle of admirers. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Deep Well of Time</h2><p>Bring the fun and energy of storytelling to your classroom or home with this comprehensive guide.

But in the isolated villages in the very north of Scotland, the villagers rely on the services of the itinerant sweep, Pete Ray, and his old-fashioned brushes. Pete is always able to find work in the Scottish highlands, until one day when Police Constable Hamish Macbeth notices blood dripping onto the floor of a villager&#39;s fireplace, and a dead body stuffed inside the chimney. The entire town of Lochdubh is certain Pete is the culprit, but Hamish doesn&#39;t believe that the affable chimney sweep is capable of committing murder. Then Pete&#39;s body is found on the Scottish moors, and the mystery deepens. Once again, it&#39;s up to Hamish to discover who&#39;s responsible for the dirty deed--and this time, the murderer may be closer than he realizes.</p><p>M.C. Beaton lives in the Cotswolds with her husband. In addition to the Hamish Macbeth series, she writes the Agatha Raisin mystery series.The Scottish Highlands that Beaton depicts with such skill are beautiful and sinister, a fitting backdrop to her Hamish Macbeth series and especially to this one, her twenty-sixth craggy-cozy. The mystery centers in the tiny Highlands village of Drim, &#x201c;a huddle of white-washed cottages&#x201d; on the banks of a sea loch, where mountains rise up at water&#x2019;s edge. There, the body of the posh new owner of a long-abandoned estate is found, stuffed up the chimney. The chimney sweep himself, who was to have been cleaning the estate chimney, is found dead on the motorway, an apparent accident victim, a few hours later. The local police feel the case is open and shut, with the chimney sweep tabbed as the murderer of the estate owner, until Constable Hamish Macbeth questions the findings, even of the forensics team. Someone has embarked on a spree, starting at the estate, and spreading to Edinburgh. Great stuff, as usual. --Connie Fletcher</p><h2>Sacred Ground: Jamgon Kongtrul On Pilgrimage And Sacred Geography (Tsadra)</h2><p><i>Sacred Ground</i> describes two journeys: a journey outward to specific pilgrimage places in eastern Tibet, and a journey inward to the sacred world of tantra, accessible through contemplation and meditation. It sheds light on Himalayan Buddhists' concepts of sacred land, places of pilgrimage in tantric Buddhism, and how pilgrimage is undertaken. It enhances our appreciation of the world and its sacred aspect everywhere&#x2014;first and foremost, where we sit now. On the basis of this judicious choice of rare Tibetan texts, translated here for the first time, correlating inner and outer pilgrimage, this book is of considerable value to the Buddhist practitioner.</p><p>"SACRED GROUND is a revelation! Here for the first timein any Western language are several key ideas: the exact way outer sacred lands relate to points in the tantric body and the parallel termiology between the types of sacred ground and the stages of attainment. Ngawang is precise and to the point." Hubert Decleer, Director of Buddhist Studies Program of the School for International Training, and author of LIGHTNING TERROR. <p>"In his continuing investigation of the mind and world of one of the most significant figures in the development of Tibetan Buddhism, Ngawang Zangpo has again given us a well-researched and richly informative setting to another jewel from Jamgon Kongtrul's writings. Anyone who is a pilgrim, in any sense of the term, will find this book fascinating."--Richard Barron (Chokyi Nyima), translator of Buddhahood without Meditation </p><p>"Ngawang Zangpo has done a remarkable job translating and commenting upon the profound and pertinent subject of sacred ground. The reader can gain a welcome appreciation for the various levels of comprehension that accompany this important subject. For many devoted Buddhists, reading this book will be like making a pilgrimage to Do-Kham and most especially to the sacred land of Tsadra. In addition, this book gives us a basis for further understanding many of the passages and references found in our tantric sadhanas. It is a pleasure to be led through this journey by the mind of a sublime master the likes of Jamgon Kongtrul with the additional authoritative clarity of Ngawang's lively commentary full of present day idioms and anecdotes. Sacred Ground is like a rich mineral spring bubbling over with important information that will help buddhists better appreciate the tremendous talent and profound spiritual realization of these great lineage holders and their lineages which through their kindness have passed into our hands."--Sangye Khandro, trans. of Perfect Conduct and The Life of Mandarava</p>Ngawang Zangpo (Hugh Leslie Thompson) completed two three-year retreats under the direction of the late Kalu Rinpoche.

In the early stages of World War II, it, together with the Heinkel He 111, formed the backbone of the German bomber arm over Poland, France, Belgium and the Low Countries, and saw action in almost every major campaign in this period. However, by the start of the Battle of Britain, the Do 17's limited range and small bomb load meant that it was ripe for replacement by the Ju 88. Though it performed well at lower altitudes, the model suffered heavy losses during raids, particularly during the Blitz and were increasingly phased out. This fully illustrated study uses detailed full-color artwork and authoritative text from an expert author to tell the full operation story of one of Nazi Germany's best light bombers from the early years of World War II.</p></p><p><p><b>Chris Goss</b> is a retired senior Royal Air Force officer who has studied the 1939&#x2013;45 air war over north-west Europe for many years, specializing in Luftwaffe air operations.

For the first time, seven Soviet admirals, along with leading naval historian Dr. Gary Weir, reveal the successful spying missions, the technological breakthroughs, the confrontations with U.S. forces, and the undersea disasters that killed many hundreds of sailors.With decades of experience on submarines or commanding submarine fleets, these seven senior admirals, many highly decorated, give us the inside stories. They detail the undersea successes such as the blockade of the U.S. submarine base in Bangor, Washington, and the innovative surveillance techniques they developed to trail the U.S. Sixth fleet in the Mediterranean. They reveal the development of the first nuclear submarines, profiling Dr. Peregudov, the father of the Soviet nuclear submarine and the internecine battles among Soviet bureaucrats that led to the deaths of many Russian sailors. And they give first hand accounts of deadly confrontations, such as the sinking of K-219, off Bermuda and the collision of USS Taurog and the Soviet K-108, including unpublished photos of the incident&#39;s aftermath. Rising Tide also reveals the many catastrophes and the occasional heroic rescues, and answers many questions surrounding the sensational loss of the Kursk, the most advanced vessel in the Russian fleet.Covering submarines from the first advanced diesel subs in the 1950s to the Kursk in 2000, with the authority only senior naval officials could deliver, Rising Tide is the complete story of the Soviet side of the gripping, secret life of the submariners in the Cold War.</p><p>Dr. Gary Weir, a leading expert on submarines, is Historian of Science and Technology at the U.S. Naval Historical Center, and Adjunct Professor of History, University of Maryland.

It is quite clear that although the Soviet technology was quite comparable to the one in the West, the Soviet doctrine and bureaucracy held the submariners from performing at 100% of their true capabilities. Quite sad that it had to be a political, rather than a military matter the deployment of a new submarine type, a new technology or a new weapon. Most important was the fear of failure that existed in the ranks of every man in this service. From commanding officers to the very last enlisted person, they all had to cope with the rigidity of the Soviet state, apart from any other potential danger regarding weather conditions, poor material quality etc. The part where it is mentioned that some crew members did not reveal serious problems in a submarine, because of that rigidity and the fear of punishment, is quite frightening for all of us who happened to live the latest years of the Cold War era. Who knows what could have happened? As for the last chapter, describing the loss of the Kursk, well... I'm afraid that this mystery will remain unsolved... At least for a decade more, even though the authors present a bundle of evidence and personal accounts from truly experienced people in the Russian Navy (and many others). In cocnlusion, a truly nice book, easy to read and comprehend, and above all, a first hand account of the conditions inside a Russian nuclear submarine (both attack and ballistic). May those people's sacrifice be the last one, and may, through these pages, some other people understand and appreciate the wonder of life. --By Stelios</p><h2>Letter from New York/Bbc Woman&#39;s Hour Broadcasts</h2><p>For six years, the author of 84 Charing Cross Road captivated audiences with her monthly BBC broadcasts about her unique adventures living in New York City.

His first novel, GARDEN STATE, was published in 1992. He has also published short fiction and essays in many US journals such as STORM and THE PARIS REVIEW.In 1973, a decaying suburban Connecticut family has a bad day. Father Benjamin Hood is a middle-aged alcoholic, tormented by canker sores, in danger of losing his job as a media and entertainment expert for a high-end brokerage house, and having an affair with a neighbor named Janey. His wife, Elena, is cold and distant, even though she gets a kick reading about impotence in Masters and Johnson and believes herself ``capable of abandon.'' Fourteen-year-old Wendy Hood's raging hormones and desire to break out lead to dry humping in basements and graveyards and a daring public display with a girlfriend at a slumber party. Older brother Paul, relegated to boarding school, gets stoned and compulsively follows the comic book capers of the Fantastic Four. On this fateful day, Janey disappears in the middle of her afternoon rendezvous with Benjamin to do some shopping; Benjamin catches Wendy and Janey's son Mike going at it; Elena confronts Benjamin about his infidelity; Benjamin and Elena find themselves at a neighborhood key party (a '60s tradition that migrated belatedly to suburbia whereby men toss their keys in a bowl at the beginning of the night and at the end of the night the women randomly select a set and go off with its owner); Janey purposely shies away from the Hood key ring; Benjamin passes out on the bathroom floor; Elena goes off with Janey's husband; Wendy wanders over to Mike's house and seduces his younger brother Sandy because Mike isn't around; Paul makes an unsuccessful play for the woman of his dreams with alcohol and drugs; and matters only get worse because a vicious northeaster rages outside. Moody (Garden State, 1992) masterfully captures suburban angst through lucid detail. But his characters lack substance so that we don't care what happens to them, and in the end, it seems, neither do they. Too cold. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Famous for his humorous writings and illustrations, he was a staff member of <em>The New Yorker</em> for more than thirty years. He died in 1961. </p><br><br><p>E. B. White, the author of such beloved classics as <em>Charlotte's Web</em>, <em>Stuart Little</em>, and <em>The Trumpet of the Swan</em>, was born in Mount Vernon, New York. He graduated from Cornell University in 1921 and, five or six years later, joined the staff of <em>The New Yorker</em> magazine, then in its infancy. He died on October 1, 1985, and was survived by his son and three grandchildren.</p><p>Mr. White's essays have appeared in <em>Harper's</em> magazine, and some of his other books are: <em>One Man's Meat</em>, <em>The Second Tree from the Corner</em>, <em>Letters of E. B. White</em>, <em>Essays of E. B. White</em>, and <em>Poems and Sketches of E. B. White</em>. He won countless awards, including the 1971 National Medal for Literature and the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, which commended him for making a "substantial and lasting contribution to literature for children."</p><p>During his lifetime, many young readers asked Mr. White if his stories were true. In a letter written to be sent to his fans, he answered, "No, they are imaginary tales . . . But real life is only one kind of life&#x2014;there is also the life of the imagination."</p></p><h2>ROSETTA&#39;S DRESS MESS</h2><p><i>Rosetta's Dress Mess</i> is the 23rd book in our Disney Fairies chapter book series, which features Tinker Bell's adventures with her fairy friends in Never Land. <br><br>Garden-talent fairy Rosetta likes one thing almost as much as her flowers&#x2014;pretty dresses!

Tried as a juvenile for Evan&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s death, Tony Mancini only served four years in prison. Now he&#x2019;s been accused of killing Alison Turnbull, a local teen and the daughter of Mancini&#x2019;s boss. But when Evan goes to meet the boy face to face he&#x2019;s surprised to find not the stone-cold killer he expected but a scared young man who swears his innocence.<br><br>Against his own wishes, and ignoring his superiors, Evan believes the boy&#x2019;s claim of innocence and decides to investigate, at potential peril to his career. But is his instinct correct, or is Mancini just trying to save himself? And how will he reconcile his actions with his memory of his father&#x2019;s murder, which has haunted him for so long? Evan Evans is up to the challenge, to be sure, and faces it all with characteristic good humor and the Welsh charm that sets Rhys Bowen&#x2019;s successful cozy series apart.<br></p><p>Rhys Bowen won the Agatha Award for best novel of the year and the Herodotus Award for best historical mystery of the year for <i>Murphy&#x2019;s Law</i>, her first installment in a new series featuring Molly Murphy and set in turn-of-the-century New York City.

A young man jumped out, his mouse brown hair and pasty face blending in with the beige of his raincoat. It was midsummer and the sky was cloudless, making the raincoat a strange choice of garment. Equally strange, it was coupled with a pair of large green gumboots that appeared too big for him. He paused, looking and listening in both directions up and down the pass, before grabbing something from the seat of the Land Rover and sprinting to a nearby stile. He looked around once more before starting to wrap the stile, spiderweb fashion, with bright yellow plastic tape. The tape read KEEP OUT. When the stile was effectively blocked, the young man ran back to the Land Rover and took off, tires spraying gravel. As he drove up the pass, he picked up a mobile phone and pressed the redial button."Sector Three now secured, sir," he said."Well done," came the crackling voice down the line. "Now get the hell out of there before they notice."&nbsp;<br>At that very moment an elderly Rover was driving up the Llanberis Pass at a sedate twenty-nine miles per hour, clearly infuriating the driver of a white van behind it. The van bore the inscription LEEKS--THE PROUD SYMBOL OF WALES, STOPPING LEAKS--theproud aim of Roberts-the-Plumber, Bangor. It tried unsuccessfully to pass on numerous occasions but was reduced to impotent horn honkings, which the driver of the Rover didn't seem to hear.At last, beyond the small village of Nant Peris, the Rover finally turned off the road to a parking area outside an old churchyard. Three sheep that had been cropping grass around the lichen-covered gravestones leaped up in alarm at the sound of the car and trotted away to safety behind the old church. The Rover's doors opened and three elderly gentlemen got out, each straightening creaky joints slowly and cautiously. Although they weren't wearing clerical collars but weatherproof windcheaters and stout walking boots, they had an aura of innocent surprise and unworldliness in their faces, usually seen in choirboys or monks. These three were, in fact, Church of England vicars and knew nothing of the austere lifestyle of the monastery. They stood, breathing deeply and looking around with expectation."I bet these old stones could tell many a tale," one of them said, walking over to the moss-grown wall that surrounded the churchyard."If they could, you wouldn't understand it, because it would be in Welsh." The second, the most cherubic-looking of the three, chuckled."Anyway, we're not going to take time to explore now." The third, leaner and fitter looking than his companions, hoisted a rucksack onto his back. "We want to make the summit before the weather changes." He raised his eyes to the mountains that rose steeply on either side. The sky was a perfect blue, without a cloud in sight.Then turning his back on the churchyard, he crossed the road where the sign indicated a footpath up the green slopes beyond. His companions followed him until they came to a stile, straddling a drystone wall. Behind the wall was a rising pasture, dotted with sheep, but the stile was impassible. It was tied across with yellow plastic tape.The first clergyman stopped and waited for his companions to catch up."They can't do this!" he exclaimed, his face pink with anger as he pointed at the taped stile. "It's a public right of way, that's what it is. It's always been a public right of way, and if any bolshie farmer thinks he can stop us from crossing his field just by putting up a piece of tape, then he can think again.""Easy now, Ronald," the cherubic vicar said, putting a hand on his friend's shoulder. "Maybe this path is under repair, or is waterlogged. I'm sure there are plenty of alternate routes up to the summit.""He's right, old man," the third clergyman said in languid, aristocratic tones. "No sense in raising your blood pressure over nothing. Remember what the doctor said."Ronald sighed and turned away. "You're right. Let's take a look at the map and see where the other paths start."But ten minutes later they were at a similar stile farther up the pass, facing a similar strip of yellow tape and the words KEEP OUT scrawled on a piece of cardboard. This time Ronald nearly exploded."That's it. Back to the car. We're going to find the nearest police station and make this farmer open up his damned public right of way!"&nbsp;<br>"Sorry about this, lads, but my hands are tied." Superintendent Meredith spread his hands in a gesture of apology, seeming to refute what he had just said. He was a big man with multiple chins that quivered as he shook his head. "We've had a directive from the powers-that-be that we're to give the Min of Ag all possible cooperation in carrying out this unpleasant task.""It's not going to be easy," a voice from the audience muttered."Look, I know it's not going to be easy, especially for those of us who work closely with the community, but it has to be done." The superintendent attempted an understanding smile. "I feel just as badly as you do about this. But it has to be stopped now. It should have been stopped before it got to Wales. It could have been if they hadn't sat there twiddling their thumbs until it was too late.""Bloody English, when have they ever sent us anything but badnews?" came another growled mutter from the back of the room.If the superintendent heard this, he pretended not to. "So we've just got to buckle down, all pull together, and make sure that there is no unpleasantness, right?" He was the only one who nodded. "The Min of Ag inspectors are already in the area. You'll be approached for assistance as needed." He looked around the audience of blank faces, then went on, "So that's about it. Let's make this go as smoothly as possible, shall we then? And if it looks as if there's going to be trouble, don't hesitate to call for backup. Got it? Right then." He stood up, brushed off his hands as if they had crumbs on them, and strode from the room."All in this together, my arse," one of the young policemen muttered over the scraping of chairs as they got to their feet.Constable Meirion Morgan fell into step beside a fellow officer. "All right for him, isn't it, Evan--sitting here in his office. I bet he's never been within twenty miles of a herd of sheep in his life."The fellow officer he had spoken to, Constable Evan Evans, smiled in agreement. He was a big chap with the build of a rugby player and a boyish face women found appealing. "You know what I'm counting on, Meirion?" he muttered confidentially. "I'm just hoping they'll take their time before they get to us up on the mountain."Meirion Morgan returned the grin. "Oh, that's right. You're transferring to plainclothes, aren't you?""I'm due to start my course next week.""Lucky bugger," Meirion said. "Still, I'm not saying that you don't deserve it.""I've been waiting long enough for the transfer to come through," Evan said. "I applied over a year ago. I was beginning to think they'd never accept me.""They'd have been daft if they hadn't, seeing the kind of help you've already given them.""People don't always take kindly to outside help, do they?" Evans commented.They joined the crowd filing from the briefing room. "You really want to do that kind of thing, do you?" Meirion asked. "Can'tsay it appeals to me. Too much stress and terrible hours. I dare say I lack ambition, but I like being home at a reasonable time and not being called out at three in the morning.""I think I'll like it just fine," Evan said. "I did start a CID training course once, when I was on the force down in Swansea.""Did you now? I never knew that. What in heaven's name were you doing in Swansea? You don't look like a South Walesian, don't sound like one either."Evan laughed. "I was born up here, but my dad got a job with the South Wales Police, so we moved down there when I was ten.""And you were on the force down there then? What made you decide to move back?""Several things." Evan left it at that. "My mum still lives down there.""Can't say I'd want to," Meirion said as they drew level with the cafeteria door. "I've only been to a city once and I felt hemmed in, if you know what I mean. Coming for a cuppa?""No thanks, I'd better be getting back," Evan said. "I'm a one-man shop up in Llanfair, and something always seems to happen when I'm away.""You've got several farms around you, haven't you?" Meirion grimaced. "So have we. I'm not looking forward to it one bit, but I suppose the super is right. It has to be done."He gave Evan a friendly nod as he pushed open the swing door into the cafeteria. Evan got a pleasant whiff of sausage and chips before the door swung to again. He paused and looked back longingly. He'd been surviving on his own for a couple of months now, and he wasn't the world's best cook. After a lifetime of living at home and then being looked after by Mrs. Williams, he was discovering that cooking wasn't as simple as it seemed. Things that looked easy enough usually required ingredients he didn't possess and never turned out like the pictures in the cookery books. Of course he could always buy a meat pie or bangers and chips at the Red Dragon across the road, but that was defeating the whole purpose of this exercise. The whole reason he was putting himself through this was for Bronwen. She had made it very clear that shewouldn't marry him until he'd had a taste of fending for himself.Evan came out of the Caernarfon Police Station and went to retrieve his motorbike. Another good thing about transferring to the CID, he decided, would be giving up that bloody motorbike. It had been issued to outstation officers as part of an efficiency drive, so that they could cover outlying farms more easily, but Evan had never really taken to it. Not that he minded the wind and rain in his face. He'd been brought up in the mountains, after all. He just didn't feel any affinity for motorbikes.He kicked it to life and pulled out of the station yard. It wouldn't have been so bad if he'd been issued an impressive 1000cc model, but this bike was so underpowered that it barely made it up the hill to Llanfair. Any burglar could easily outrun him up a mountainside.The last of the housing estates was left behind, and green uplands soared on either side. A stream danced merrily beside him. Flowers grew in profusion, spilling over the drystone walls. The high pastures were dotted with sheep. It was the perfect pastoral scene, one that he usually relished, but today he looked around with a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. This was the calm before the storm. Maybe nothing would ever be the same again.The town of Llanberis was chockablock with families on holiday. The ice cream vendor and the souvenir shops were doing a roaring trade. There was a long line waiting for the next train on the little rack railway up Mt. Snowdon, and a cheerful <i>toot-toot</i> announced that it had just started its climb to the summit. Evan slowed as holidaymakers strolled across the road, trailing children and dripping ice cream. He wondered what would be happening to them. Would they all be sent home? Would the whole area be quarantined?He negotiated the holiday crowds successfully, then let the throttle out as the road narrowed and the pass rose ahead, snaking up to the high country. He felt the exhilaration of wind in his face. Green walls rose on either side, topped with sheets of scree and the rocky crags he knew so well--Snowdon and its outcroppings on his right, and, beyond the thin finger of lake, the twin peaks of the Glydrs on his left. Evan knew every route up the mountains, everychallenging climb in the area, but there hadn't been much time for climbing recently.Nant Peris, with its old church and graveyard, passed on his right. Then there were no more houses until Llanfair. As he pulled up outside his little police substation, he saw a car parked outside it and a white-haired man standing at the station door. On hearing Evan he marched toward him."Are you the officer who is supposed to be on duty here?" he demanded in a well-bred English voice."That's right, sir. Constable Evans. How can I help you?""Aren't police stations supposed to be manned at all times?""Sorry, sir. I'm the only officer stationed up here, and I was called down to headquarters," Evan said. "There's an telephone outside, and they will always send up a squad car in an emergency. So what can I do for you?""What you can do is go and talk to some damned farmer," the man said. "We're here on a walking holiday, and we were just about to hike up Glydr Fach when we found the path had been blocked off." Evan glanced over at the car where two other elderly men with round cherubic faces watched from wound-down windows. "My fellow members of the clergy and I have been coming here every summer since 1956, and until now we have had no problems."Evan was just realizing the implications of the man's complaint. "The path was blocked, you say?" he asked."Taped across, more like it," one of the other elderly gentlemen chimed in from the car. "Lots of yellow plastic tape. And not just one path either. We drove up to the second footpath, and it had tape across it too. And the words 'Keep Out.'""Some bolshie farmer trying to deny an ancient right of way," the first man said. "It happens from time to time. Some chap thinks he can ignore a public footpath across his land. But we never let them get away with it. We'd like you to go and talk to him, Constable. Let him know that it's against the law to block off a right of way.""I'll come down and see it with you," Evan said, "but I don't think the farmer had anything to do with it this time. I don't knowwhether you've been reading the papers, but I'm afraid that foot-and-mouth disease has spread to this part of Wales. I was just at a briefing in Caernarfon, and it doesn't look good. It seems it's only a matter of time before the farmers here have to slaughter their flocks."The man's bluster evaporated. "But that's terrible," he said with concern. "So you think that was why they've blocked off the footpaths?""I would imagine so, sir. I understand the Ministry of Agriculture's men are already in the area doing inspections, and they'll be doing everything they can to stop the disease from spreading--which would mean closing footpaths, I expect.""Of course, I quite understand," the vicar said, nodding to his fellows. "They wouldn't want to risk having anyone carrying infected soil on his boots. Well, this is a setback, I must say.""It will completely spoil our holiday," one of the men in the car said."I should think it will spoil a lot of holidays," Evan said. "The timing couldn't have been worse, right at the beginning of the school summer holidays too. It will be a disaster for all the local business people.""Yes, I suppose it will. Never thought of that." The vicar stood staring up at the mountains with a wistful look on his face. "So what do you suggest, Constable? Do you think we should get out as soon as possible and try somewhere else?"Evan glanced up at the hills, from which came the sporadic bleating of sheep. "You're all clergymen, you say? Then I suggest you gentlemen do some serious prayin...</p><h2>Have Spacesuit Will Travel</h2><p>One minute Kip Russell was walking about in his backyard, testing out an old space suit and dreaming about going to the Moon -- and the next he was out cold, the captive of an insidious space pirate.

And while the nuts and bolts of his adventures are entertainment enough, his knack for building suspense and employing understated drama makes his autobiography read like a novel: "The morning was sunny and calm, and Rob looked as though he'd lain down on his side and fallen asleep. Around him the undisturbed snow sparkled in the sun. I stared at his bare left hand ... I wondered what a mountaineer with Rob's experience was doing without a glove." </p><p>Breashears also likes to remind his audience of humble beginnings surmounted: his early climbing days when he was known as "the kid," and a winter he spent sleeping under a sheet of plywood during the Wyoming oil boom when he was called "the worm." But mostly he documents his filmmaking career and climbing passion, both of which he approaches with an obsessive fervor. Readers interested in either pursuit will find <i>High Exposure</i> a fascinating traverse across the spine of the world. <i>--Ben Tiffany</i></p><b>David Breashears</b> has made four trips to Everest's summit. His cinematic achievements include the IMAXï¿½ movie <i>Everest</i> and "Everest: The Death Zone" for the PBS series <i>NOVA.</i> He is the recipient of four Emmy awards for his accomplishments in cinematography.

Materials prepared for presentation to authorities when making an application for citizenship. 2. Documents presented as proof of citizenship.<br><br>There are those in America today who seem to feel we must audition for our citizenship, with "Patriot" offered as the badge for those found narrowly worthy. Let this book stand as Wendell Berry&#x2019;s application, for he is one of those faithful, devoted critics envisioned by the Founding Fathers to be the life&#x2019;s blood and very future of the nation they imagined. Adams, Jefferson and Madison would have found great clarity in his prose and great hope in his vision. And today&#x2019;s readers will be moved and encouraged by his anger and his refusal to surrender in the face of desperate odds. Books get written for all sorts of reasons, and this book was written out of necessity.<br><br>Citizenship Papers collects nineteen new essays, from celebrations of exemplary lives to critiques of American life, including "A Citizen&#x2019;s Response [to the new National Security Strategy]" a ringing call of caution to a nation standing on the brink of global catastrophe.<br></p><p>Wendell Berry is a former professor of English at the University of Kentucky.Berry says that these recent essays mostly say again what he has said before. His faithful readers may think he hasn't, however, said any of it <i>better</i> before. So it always seems with Berry, one of English's finest stylists, as perspicuous as T. H. Huxley at his best and as perspicacious as John Ruskin at his. Like Huxley, Berry cares about how life persists; like Ruskin, about how economics and politics impinge upon life. Naturally, then, his constant subject is the fostering of life, especially human life--in a word, agriculture. As Huxley in "On a Piece of Chalk" (1865) shows how a little natural chalk implicates vast evolutionary processes, Berry in "Let the Farm Judge" shows how one facet of agriculture--sound sheep raising--implicates all of it. Like Ruskin, Berry descries more deeply than others the dangers major crises reveal; if Ruskin's "Storm Cloud of the Nineteenth Century" (1884) is the most penetrating critique of industrialism in his day (the storm cloud was air pollution), Berry's pieces on 9/11 and official reaction to it constitute the most powerful response to today's global industrialism. In those essays and throughout, Berry sees America persisting, as it has for a century, to choose industrialism over agrarianism. He hopefully counsels reversing that choice and, so doing, again embracing life and community. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

She argued that a rejection of psychoanalysis as bourgeois and patriarchal was fatal for feminism. However it may have been used, she pointed out, psychoanalysis is not a recommendation <i>for</i> a patriarchal society, but rather an analysis <i>of</i> one. "If we are interested in understanding and challenging the oppression of women," she says, "we cannot afford to neglect psychoanalysis." In an introduction written specially for this reissue, Mitchell reflects on the changing relationship between these two major influences on twentieth-century thought. Original and provocative, <i>Psychoanalysis and Feminism</i> remains an essential component of the feminist canon.</p><p><b>Juliet Mitchell</b>, the author of <i>Psychoanalysis and Feminism</i>, is currently a visiting professor in Comparative Literature at Yale University, where she is also a Fellow of the Whitney Humanities Center.

During Eisner&#39;s years in the military, and particularly during the many field trips he made for P.S. Magazine, he observed camp life at close range. Some of the stories in this novel are comical, some heart-rending, some frightening, yet all display the incredible insight into humanity characteristic of Eisner&#39;s entire oeuvre. The first edition of this graphic novel features a full-color cover painted by the artist, with a matte and spot-gloss finish, interior cover flaps, and special sepia-colored ink printed on high-quality antique paper.</p><p>Drawing on memories from his World War II service days and his army-sponsored trips to Korea and Vietnam, comics innovator Will Eisner put together <i>Last Day in Vietnam</i>, a six-story collection that reveals the strange feelings that arise in soldiers during wartime. From the long, rollicking title story to the somber, bureaucratic cautionary tale "A Purple Heart for George," Eisner consistently finds new angles on old material, while maintaining the mainstream position that war, though ridiculous, must be fought when necessary. The sepia tones of the stories and interspersed photos of Korea and Vietnam add gravity to the already weighty tales, but the book never becomes heavy-handed. <i>Last Day in Vietnam</i> is impressive work from an artist with an impressive record. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><h2>Mounds of earth and shell (Native Dwellings)</h2><p>Much of what we know of life among the inhabitants of North America before the arrival of Europeans comes from mounds in the southeastern U.S. However, there is much debate among scholars about the findings.

The sun rises to the height of its power on the summer solstice, and Midsummer Eve is filled with fairy mischief and magic. Anna Franklin reveals the origins and customs of this enchanting holiday with: <br> <br>ï¿½Myths and lore: The gods and goddesses of Midsummer, rolling wheels, the Midsummer tree, circle dancing, and torchlight processions <br>ï¿½Midsummer magic and divination: Fairy contact, spells, empowering magical tools with solstice sun energy, Midsummer Eve pillow divination <br>ï¿½Traditional summertime treats: Elderflower Fritters, Gooseberry Fool, Coamhain Soup, Strawberry Wine, Heather Ale, Clary Sage Tea <br>ï¿½Seasonal rituals: Rite of the Oak King and the Holly King, Cornish Flower Ritual, Witch Rite for Midsummer Day, Drawing Down the Sun <br>ï¿½Midsummer herb craft: Gathering and drying herbs for magical oils, incenses, inks, and teas; herb recipes, from Amun Ra to Sun Goddess Oil <br>ï¿½ <br>First Runner Up for the 2003 Coaltion of Visionary Resources (COVR) Award for Best Non-fiction Book <br> <br></p><p>Summer solstice celebrants will find plenty of inspirational rituals, magic spells, and recipes in Anna Franklin's <i>Midsummer</i>. As in her previous book about the early fall festival of <i>Lammas</i>, Franklin can be whimsical as well as reverent. From the building of a magical bonfire to the staging of elaborate solstice rituals involving priests and priestesses, Franklin offers something for every level of pagan. In the section on "Midsummer Magic and Divination," Franklin gives instructions for placing various herbs and charms beneath the pillow to welcome prophetic dreams. Those who are inspired by the more romantic Shakespearean take on Midsummer's Eve can try some of Franklin's love divination techniques, such as flicking an apple seed toward the ceiling to see if your love is requited. Franklin also gives specific instructions for performing the "Rites of Midsummer." For instance, "The altar should be decorated with golds and yellows--this theme is echoed through candles, clothes and flowers.... Centrally placed should be a sun wheel or sun representation." And for the Martha Stewart-style pagan there are some excellent recipes, including Anise Tea and Comfrey Fritters. <i>--Gail Hudson</i><p>Anna Franklin (England) has been a witch for 30 years, and a Pagan in her heart for all her life.

In <i>Let Me Off at the Top</i>, Burgundy will share never-before-told stories of his childhood and the events that led him to choose a career in the news business.

Ron Burgundy finally opens up to fans in this widely anticipated tell-all autobiography.<b>AUTHOR&#x2019;S NOTE</b><br>&nbsp;<br>It took me eight years to write this book. The research alone&#x2014;fact-checking, reading the source materials, asking questions&#x2014;was endless and I didn&#x2019;t care for it that much. I just didn&#x2019;t. But I persisted because I knew what I was doing was truly very important. A book is never the work of one man. Many people contribute to its failure, or as in this case, its success. Dorathoy Roberts at the Harvard Widener Library was instrumental in recovering so many facts and nautical terms. Janart Prancer aided my work immensely with her near-encyclopedic understanding of rare manuscripts in the Herzog August Library, Wolfenbï¿½ttel, Germany. Esther Nausï¿½baum, head librarian at the prestigious Kirkland School of Dinosaurs, was instrumental in tracking down indispensable paleoecological records for chapter 15 in this book. Herb Kolowsky was ever watchful and patient, reading over many drafts of the manuscript as well as cleaning my gutters. I conï¿½sulted with my dear friend and lover Doris Kearns Goodwin over many breakfasts in bed. Her sharp intellect and sharper teeth found their way into practically every page. Although we are no longer lovers because I don&#x2019;t know why, her knowledge of presidential history is the basis for chapter 12. Her dogged enthusiasm for the project was only outpaced by her enthusiï¿½asm for lovemaking, which I could barely equal. I don&#x2019;t know what to say about Doris really except if she&#x2019;s still out there and she would like another bounce, I would be game. Johnny Bench was an invaluable spell-checker. Lars Mankike brought an artistic eye to the project and a kind of European nihilism that was completely unnecessary. We fought often and he got what he deserved, so I&#x2019;m not even sure why I&#x2019;m thanking him here, but it&#x2019;s too late now. Sandy Duncan is full of boundless energy. What can I say about Veronica Corningstone, the love of my life? We&#x2019;ve had our ups and downs for sure, and usuï¿½ally the downs were because of something stupid she said or did while losing her blood. You really can&#x2019;t fault women for being irrational. Blood drips out of them willy-nilly and there&#x2019;s nothing they can do about it. It&#x2019;s like being a hemophiliac. I suspect science will one day cure them of this blood-dripping disease but until then, <i>Vive la diffï¿½rence</i>. Finally Baxter, my dog and best friend, saw me through many tough hours as I struggled with my emotions during this projï¿½ect. His love and support sustained me through extremely difï¿½ficult excavations into my past. Only Baxter knows the pain I have lived. Our nightly talks formed the basis for what you hold in your hand now. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>WHY WRITE THIS BOOK?</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Does mankind really need another book dumped onto the giant garbage heap of books already out there? Is there some pressing desire for the wisdom of a humble News Anchor in this world? Will it add to the great literary achievements throughout time or will it be lost in a swamp of trivial scribï¿½bling like pornography&#x2014;devoured and then destroyed out of shame? I stand here (I write standing up) and I say, &#x201c;No!&#x201d; No, this book will NOT be lost! This book is necessary. It&#x2019;s an imï¿½portant work from an important man. I was the number one News Anchor in all of San Diego. My name is Ron Burgundy and what you have in your hands is a very big deal. It&#x2019;s...my...life. It&#x2019;s my words. It&#x2019;s my gift to you.</p><h2>Love in a Dish . . . and Other Culinary Delights by M.F.K.

In this collection of some of her finest works, we learn that Fisher&#x2019;s palette was not only well trained in gastronomical masterpieces, but in life&#x2019;s best pleasures as well.<br><br><i>Love in a Dish . . . and Other Culinary Delights by M.F.K. Fisher</i> is an instructional manual on how to live, eat, and love brought together by prolific researcher and culinary enthusiast Anne Zimmerman. With great care she has selected essays that sometimes forgive our lustful appetites, yet simultaneously celebrate them, as in Once a Tramp, Always . . . &#x201d; and Love in a Dish,&#x201d; which guides us down the path to marital bliss via the family dining table.<br><br>It is through this carefully chosen selection, which includes two essays never before collected in book form, that we encounter Fisher&#x2019;s bold passion for cuisine and an introduction to her idea of what constitutes the delicious life.</p><p><b>M.F.K.

Based on a lifetime of experience with children--their problems, their delights, their challenges--Dr. Rudolf Dreikurs, one of America&#39;s foremost child psychiatrists presents an easy to follow program that teaches parents how to cope with the common childhood problems that occur from toddler through preteen years. This warm and reassuring reference helps parents to understand their children&#39;s actions better, giving them the guidance necessary to discipline lovingly and effectively.</p><p><b>Rudolf Dreikurs</b>, M.D., was an eminent child-psychiatrist who practiced in Chicago. He was the author of many child-rearing and family guides.</p><h2>The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies (Potter 23 Tales)</h2><p>The six Flopsy Bunnies have a narrow escape from Mr. McGregor&#39;s garden.</p><p>Beatrix Potter is one of the world&#39;s best-loved children&#39;s authors of all time. From her first book, The Tale of Peter Rabbit (1902) she went on to create a series of stories based around animal characters including Mrs Tiggy-winkle, Mr Jeremy Fisher and Tom Kitten. Her humorous, lively tales and beautiful illustrations have become a natural part of childhood.A source of inspiration was the Lake District where she lived for the last thirty years of her life as a farmer and conservationist.It is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is "soporific". I have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces; but then I am not a rabbit. <p> They certainly had a very soporific effect upon the Flopsy Bunnies! </p></p><h2>Beyond Business as Usual: Vestry Leadership Development</h2><p>This is full of resources for forming the vestry as a learning community. It deals with the &#34;soft&#34; side of leadership that enables the pastor and vestry together to journey along the leadership path. Each chapter can be read and reviewed at a series of vestry meetings or as part of a vestry retreat, and includes questions for group and individual discussion. Includes resources for vestries, based upon different preferred learning styles, for the formation part of the vestry meeting or retreat.</p><p><p>Neal O.

Cynthia Harrod-Eagles has done such a good job of making her hero a no-nonsense, everyday kind of bloke that she has probably hurt her chances of turning Slider into a TV series character. But readers who enjoy the subtle nuances of flawed reality will relish her pace and polish, as Slider's old friendship with an exotic dancer called Busty Parnell involves him in the murder of her flatmate, gay dancer Jay Paloma. It wouldn't be a Slider story without female problems of a personal nature; in this case the unexpected return of an ex-wife, the jealousy of a current lover, and the amorous attention of a new colleague come into play. There's also a suspicious cabby with smelly feet and lots of acutely observed political infighting, especially a delightfully awful farewell party for a retiring superintendent. Other Sliders in paperback include <i>Blood Lines</i>, <i>Death to Go</i>, <i>Grave Music</i>, and <i>Orchestrated Death</i>.Somebody's threatening to kill him, exotic dancer Jay Paloma tells Inspector Bill Slider (Blood Lines, 1996, etc.); somebody's been phoning him and hanging up, and, besides that, writing him blustering letters. Then, the day after Slider's sent Paloma on his way with an admonition to save the next nasty letter that comes in, somebody beats him to death in the White City Estate flat he shares with stripper-turned-barmaid Valerie (Busty) Parnell. It would be a perfectly ordinary murder--except that White City Estate's already in the middle of a violent crime wave (community patrol copper Andy Cosgrove is lying in a coma after his own beating), and neither Paloma's professional associates at the Pomona Club nor his secretive lover looks to be up to any good. What are the connections among between Paloma's murder, the attack on Cosgrove, and the flow of drugs through the Pomona Club? And how can Slider and his men at Shepherd's Bush--this time including sexy, outspoken Tony Hart (whose status as a black female constable makes her ``the PC DC'')--ever tie the loose ends together when Slider's getting nothing but frowns from his mate, Inspector Ron Carver, and nothing but soporific smiles from his boss, temporary Superintendent Eric Honeyman, who can't retire fast enough to suit Slider? A neatly solved puzzle, the latest installment in the saga of Slider's domestic woes, and some of the best cop talk on either side of the Atlantic. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

She lives with her family in Westport, Connecticut.crusts &amp; toppings<br><br>A pie will never be truly perfect without a great piecrust and topping, so in this chapter I&#x2019;ve included my favorite time-ï¿½tested crust and topping recipes. I strongly urge you to make your own pie shell as opposed to using a store-ï¿½bought version. It will take a bit more time and effort, but there&#x2019;s no question it&#x2019;s well worth it.<br><br>Of course, we begin with the basic Traditional Pastry Piecrust (page 4). I know that working with pastry pie dough can be intimidating. I promise you, though, it&#x2019;s not as challenging as you think. The trick to creating a truly amazing flaky, buttery piecrust is nothing more than correctly combining the right ingredients at the right temperature.<br><br>While everyone should have a traditional crust recipe in his or her arsenal, sometimes it&#x2019;s fun to mix it up with more unï¿½expected variations. In this chapter, you&#x2019;ll find some great alternative crusts, such as Oreo Cookie Crust (page 10), Graham Cracker Crust (page 8), and even Pretzel Crust (page 11). Likewise, toppings are also a great way to create recipe variations and have some fun. This chapter includes a sweet, melt-ï¿½in-ï¿½your-ï¿½mouth Cinnamon Sugar Crumb Topping (page 13), tropical Coconut Crumb Topping (page 13), and crunchy Walnut Crumb Topping (page 15).<br><br>Each pie recipe in this book will offer a standard crust and (if applicable) preferred topping choice. But always remember, these are just suggestions to get you started. I strongly encourage you to play around and swap out different crusts and toppings. It&#x2019;s an easy way to create a lot of variation in a single recipe.<br><br>Traditional Pastry Piecrust<br><br>Try this basic crust with Lattice Sour Cherry Pie (page 35), Maple Custard Pie (page 69), Peanut Butter Pie (page 95), Birthday Cake Surprise &#x201c;Pie&#x201d; (page 109), Open-ï¿½Faced Apricot Raspberry Pie with an Apricot Glaze (page 23), Pumpkin Meringue Pie (page 51), and Turtle Pecan Pie (page 101).<br><br>Makes enough for one 9-ï¿½ or 10-ï¿½inch double-ï¿½crust piecrust<br><br>2 cups unbleached all-ï¿½purpose flour<br><br>1 teaspoon salt<br><br>3&#x2044;4 cup plus 2 tablespoons Crisco, cold<br><br>5 tablespoons water, ice-ï¿½cold<br><br>1&#x2044;2 cup heavy cream<br><br>In a medium bowl, mix together the flour and salt. Add the Crisco to the flour mixture. Either with a pastry blender or with your fingertips, mix the ingredients together with an up-ï¿½and-ï¿½down chopping motion until the dough forms coarse, pea-ï¿½size crumbs. Note: I prefer to use my fingertips, but take care not to overhandle the dough, because it will become difficult to work with; when dough is overï¿½handled, the Crisco becomes too incorporated. In the perfect pie, the Crisco will have a marbleized look when the dough is rolled out, and you will actually be able to see Crisco swirls within the uncooked dough.<br><br>Add the ice-ï¿½cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, delicately incorporating each tablespoon into the flour mixture before you add the next. You may have to use 1 more or 1 less tablespoon of water than the amount recommended, depending upon the humidity in your kitchen at the time of baking. You will know you have added just the right amount of water when the dough forms a ball that easily holds together.<br><br>Use your palm to form the dough into a disk shape, wrap it with plastic, and place it in the refrigerator to chill for at least 30 minutes. Once the dough has chilled, divide the disk in half. You now have enough dough for either one 9-ï¿½ or 10-ï¿½inch double-ï¿½crust (1 pie shell and 1 top crust) or two 9-ï¿½ or 10-ï¿½inch single crusts (pie shell only). If you are making a single-ï¿½crust pie, you will use only one half of the dough per pie. Wrap the remaining half in plastic and reserve it in the refrigerator for future use; the dough can be reserved in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Alternatively, you can make a second single-ï¿½crust pie shell, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap, and freeze it for future use; it will keep for up to 1 month.<br><br>Preparing prebaked pie shells<br><br>A number of recipes in this book call for prebaked pie shells for the single-ï¿½crust pies. Follow these directions before adding the desired filling.<br><br>Preheat the oven to 425ï¿½F.<br><br>To prepare the pie shell, divide the disk of dough in half, setting one half to the side. On a clean, lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough with a rolling pin until it forms a 10-ï¿½inch circle. Fold the circle in half, place it in the pie plate so the edges of the circle drop over the rim, and unfold the dough to completely cover the pie plate. To crimp the pie dough, use your forefingers and thumbs. Press down with your forefingers and up with your thumbs to crimp the dough. Continue to crimp until the entire pie is completed. Brush heavy cream over the crimped edges to create a perfect, golden brown finish. Line the bottom of the crust with parchment paper and place pie weights on top to ensure the edges do not fall into the shell while the crust is baking. If you do not have pie weights, dried beans also work well.<br><br>To bake, place the pie plate on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until a golden brown color is achieved. Before removing the shell from the oven, make sure that the crust under the parchment paper has turned a golden brown.<br>Graham Cracker Crust<br><br>Graham Cracker Crust is a great way to infuse sweetness and texture into a pie. Try this crust with Graham Cracker Cream Fluff Pie (page 67), White Chocolate Raspberry Swirl Pie (page 83), and Banoffee Pie (page 106).<br><br>Makes one 9-ï¿½inch crust<br><br>24 graham cracker sheets finely chopped (11&#x2044;2 cups)<br><br>1 tablespoon sugar<br><br>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br><br>Preheat the oven to 350ï¿½F.<br><br>In a food processor, pulsate the graham crackers until they are finely chopped. (If you do not have a food processor, you can also place the graham crackers in a plastic sandwich or freezer bag and roll over them with a rolling pin to crush the crackers into crumbs.) In a medium bowl, mix together the graham cracker crumbs and sugar. Add the melted butter, using your fingertips to incorporate it with the graham cracker mixture. Spread the graham cracker mixture evenly across the bottom and sides of a 9-ï¿½inch pie plate and carefully pat flat so that it covers the entire dish. There should be no gaps in the crust.<br><br>Bake the crust for about 5 minutes, or until it&#x2019;s golden brown. Cool the pie shell for 30 minutes before adding your desired filling.<br><br>Graham Cracker Macadamia Coconut Crust<br><br>This bold crust packs in all the sweetness of Graham Cracker Crust (page 8), but with the addition of a coconut twist and even more crunch, thanks to the macadamia nuts. Turn Key Lime pie on its ear by using this unexpected crust for Lime Pie with Coconut Macadamia Crust (page 126) and Key Lime&#x2013;ï¿½Blackberry Chiffon Pie (page 121).<br><br>Makes one 9-ï¿½inch crust<br><br>24 graham cracker sheets (11&#x2044;2 finely chopped cups)<br><br>1 cup sweetened shredded coconut<br><br>1&#x2044;2 cup unsalted macadamia nuts<br><br>1 tablespoon sugar<br><br>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br><br>In a food processor, pulsate the graham crackers, shredded coconut, macadamia nuts, and sugar until they are finely chopped and combined. Pour the ingredients into a medium bowl and incorporate the melted butter. Spread the mixture evenly across the bottom and sides of a 9-ï¿½inch pie plate and carefully pat flat so that it covers the entire dish. There should be no gaps in the crust. Set the pie crust aside until you are ready to add your desired pie filling.<br><br>Oreo Cookie Crust<br><br>This crust pumps up the volume by providing a rich chocolate shell that will transform even the most basic filling into an out-ï¿½of-ï¿½this-ï¿½world concoction. For an easy treat, just fill this crust with a basic chocolate or vanilla cream filling. Also be sure to try this with Almond Joy Pie (page 89) and Chocolate Silk Pie (page 65).<br><br>Makes one 9-ï¿½inch crust<br><br>20 Oreo cookies<br><br>1&#x2044;2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br><br>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br><br>2 tablespoons whole milk<br><br>Preheat the oven to 350ï¿½F.<br><br>Place the Oreo cookies and cinnamon in a food processor and pulse them together until they are ground into fine crumbs. In a medium bowl, mix together the crumbs and melted butter, using a fork to combine. Add and incorporate the milk, 1&#x2044;2 tablespoon at a time, stopping when the crumbs are moist enough to mold into a pie shell (this may take only 11&#x2044;2 tablespoons of milk to accomplish).<br><br>Spread the Oreo crust mixture evenly across the bottom and sides of a 9-ï¿½inch pie plate and carefully pat flat so that it covers the entire dish. There should be no gaps in the crust. Bake for about 5 minutes, until slightly raised and firm. Cool the pie shell for 30 minutes before adding your desired pie filling.<br><br>Pretzel Crust<br><br>Pretzel Crust is about as untraditional as it gets, but I&#x2019;ve found that this salty crust is a perfect complement to otherwise sweet pies. Try this with Candy Bar Pie (page 91).<br><br>Makes one 9-ï¿½inch crust<br><br>2 cups pretzel sticks, chopped into fine pieces<br><br>1&#x2044;4 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar<br><br>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted<br><br>Preheat the oven to 350ï¿½F.<br><br>In a large bowl, mix together the chopped pretzels and brown sugar. Pour the melted butter over the dry ingredients and use your fingertips to combine all of the ingredients. Spread the pretzel mixture evenly across the bottom and sides of a 9-ï¿½inch pie plate so that it covers the entire dish, with no gaps in the crust.<br><br>Place the piecrust in the oven and bake for about 10 minutes, or until the crust turns a golden brown. Remove the piecrust from the oven and allow it to cool before use.<br><br>Cinnamon Sugar Crumb Topping<br><br>This basic sweet crumb topping will absolutely melt in your mouth. Use this with any fruit pie if you prefer your treats on the sweeter side. Be sure to try it with Apple-ï¿½Cranberry Pie (page 21), Mixed Berry Crumb Pie (page 26), Blueberry-ï¿½Rhubarb Crumb Pie (page 31), Pear-ï¿½Ginger Pie (page 43), and Blueberry Crumb Cake (page 190). Not only is this crumb topping a great pie topper, but it also works wonderfully atop crumb cakes and tea breads.<br><br>Makes enough topping for one 9-ï¿½inch pie<br><br>1&#x2044;2 cup unbleached all-ï¿½purpose flour<br><br>1&#x2044;3 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar<br><br>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br><br>1&#x2044;4 teaspoon salt<br><br>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold and cut into 1&#x2044;4-ï¿½inch cubes<br><br>In a large bowl, mix together the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Using a pastry blender, incorporate the butter by cutting it into the flour until the butter forms small, pea-ï¿½size pieces.<br><br>Pair the topping with a traditional pastry pie shell and the filling of your choice. Once the filling has been placed in the pie shell, sprinkle the cinnamon sugar crumb topping evenly over the filling until it is completely covered. Bake as directed.<br><br>Coconut Crumb Topping<br><br>Coconut Crumb Topping always catches people off guard and is an amazingly simple way to incorporate a tropical twist into your pies. This chewy crumb topping works great with summertime pies like Pineapple-ï¿½Pomegranate Pie with a Coconut Crumb (page 45). If you want to get really creative, try this topping with Blueberry-ï¿½Rhubarb Crumb Pie (page 31) or Mixed Berry Crumb Pie (page 26).<br><br>Makes enough topping for one 9-ï¿½inch pie<br><br>1&#x2044;2 cup unbleached all-ï¿½purpose flour<br><br>1&#x2044;3 cup firmly packed light brown sugar<br><br>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br><br>1&#x2044;4 teaspoon salt<br><br>1&#x2044;2 cup sweetened shredded coconut<br><br>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold and cut into 1&#x2044;4-ï¿½inch cubes<br><br>In a large bowl, mix together the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and shredded coconut. Using a pastry blender, incorporate the butter by cutting it into the flour until the butter forms small, pea-ï¿½size pieces.<br><br>Pair the topping with a traditional pastry pie shell and the filling of your choice. Once the filling has been placed in the pie shell, sprinkle the coconut crumb topping evenly over the filling until it is completely covered. Bake as directed.<br><br>Walnut Crumb Topping<br><br>Walnut Crumb Topping adds sustenance and texture to pies. If you&#x2019;re not a fan of walnuts, try substituting pecans, almonds, or your favorite nut (you can even do a nut mixture!). Try this with Pear-ï¿½Ginger Pie (page 43), Black Plum Pie (page 48), and Cranberry Pie with Walnut Crumb (page 33).<br><br>Makes enough for one 9-ï¿½inch pie<br><br>1&#x2044;2 cup unbleached all-ï¿½purpose flour<br><br>2&#x2044;3 cup firmly packed light brown sugar<br><br>11&#x2044;2 teaspoons ground cinnamon<br><br>1&#x2044;4 teaspoon salt<br><br>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold and cut into 1&#x2044;4-ï¿½inch cubes<br><br>1&#x2044;4 cup chopped walnuts<br><br>In a large bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Using a pastry blender, incorporate the butter by cutting it into the flour until the butter forms small, pea-ï¿½size pieces. Add in the walnuts, using your fingers to gently incorporate them into the crumb base.<br><br>Pair this topping with a traditional pastry pie shell and the filling of your choice. Once the filling has been placed in the pie shell, distribute the walnut crumb topping evenly over the filling until it is completely covered.

Complementing the images are sketches of these and other cars&#x2015;rarely seen drawings that give insight into the conceptual and development stages of the automobiles. Now in its fourth printing, <i>Speed, Style, and Beauty</i> is the first book on cars to center its discussion squarely on the car's role as an art object. The 29 chapters, by two of the best known and most respected authors writing about cars today, gives the indispensable background information, but also approaches the cars the way an art historian would approach fine sculpture&#x2015;treating them as consummate works of decorative art for the modern age. With over 160 color images by world-renowned photographer Michael Furman, plus an introductory interview with Ralph Lauren who discusses the links between the cars and his overall design philosophy, this is an elegant yet informative book that will delight both the rampant car enthusiast and aficionados of great design in any form. The sleekly curved chrome and steel of these timeless dream machines conjures the glamour of the 1930s, the opulent ease of the 1950s and the charged excitement of the 1980s&#x2015;the perfect marriage of speed, style and beauty.</p><p></p><h2>Magnus the Red: Master of Prospero (3) (The Horus Heresy: Primarchs)</h2><p>The third novel&nbsp;in The Horus Heresy: Primarchs series, a brand new sequence of novels focused on the superhuman sons of the Emperor.<br><br>Lord of the mystical and uncanny, Magnus the Red has long studied the ancient crafts of sorcery.

Petty</p><h2>Blood Passion: The Ludlow Massacre and Class War in the American West</h2><p><p>By early April 1914, Colorado Governor Elias Ammons thought the violence in his state&#x2019;s strike-bound southern coal district had eased enough that he could begin withdrawing the Colorado National Guard, deployed six months earlier as military occupiers. But Ammons misread the signals, and on April 20, 1914, a full-scale battle erupted between the remaining militiamen and armed strikers living in a tent colony at the small railroad town of Ludlow. Eight men were killed in the fighting, which culminated in the burning of the colony. The next day, the bodies of two women and eleven children were found suffocated in a below-ground shelter. The &#x201c;Ludlow Massacre,&#x201d; as it quickly became known, launched a national call-to-arms for union supporters to join a ten-day guerrilla war along more than two hundred miles of the eastern Rockies. The convulsion of arson and violence killed more than thirty people and didn&#x2019;t end until President Woodrow Wilson sent in the U.S. Army. Overall at least seventy-five men, women, and children were killed in seven months, likely the nation&#x2019;s deadliest labor struggle.<br><br>In <i>Blood Passion,</i> journalist Scott Martelle explores this little-noted tale of political corruption and repression and immigrants&#x2019; struggles against dominant social codes of race, ethnicity, and class. More than a simple labor dispute, the events surrounding Ludlow embraced some of the most volatile social movements of the early twentieth century, pitting labor activists, socialists, and anarchists against the era&#x2019;s powerful business class, including John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and helped give rise to the modern twins of corporate public relations and political &#x201c;spin.&#x201d; But at its heart, <i>Blood Passion</i> is the dramatic story of small lives merging into a movement for change and of the human struggle for freedom and dignity.</p></p><p>"<i>Blood Passion</i> is the definitive account of a major landmark in the American struggle for social justice. And the way Scott Martelle tells the story is splendid proof that history can both be written as vividly as a novel and also be documented with scrupulous care." - <b>Adam Hochschild</b>, author of <i>Bury the Chains: Prophets and Rebels in the Fight to Free an Empire's Slaves</i> <p>"We must welcome this carefully-researched study of one of the most dramatic, violent, and important episodes in the history of labor struggles in this country." - <b>Howard Zinn</b>, author of <i>A People's History of the United States</i></p>A few years back I encountered a footnote reference in a book to upwards of 100 men, women and children killed in a months-long war between striking coal miners and the Colorado National Guard. My first thought: Why didn't I know that? I knew about the April 1914 Ludlow Massacre, when two mothers and 11 children died after marauding Guardsmen torched a strikers' tent colony. But the broader war came as a revelation (the death toll was closer to 75). It was telling that such a protracted showdown between capital and labor had been reduced to a literal footnote. History is written by the victors, and labor has not been victorious very often. Curiosity drove me deeper into the history, and it quickly became apparent there was more here than a single newspaper or magazine article. <i>Blood Passion</i> is the result. <p>Although <i>Blood Passion</i> explores the violent trajectory of a labor strike, it is not a work of labor history. Rather, it is a journalist's take on a story of oppression and rebellion, of ordinary people revolting under a corrupt political and economic system, and of immigrants who discovered that they had to fight for their bit of the American Dream. From this country's earliest days, we have wrestled with the conflicting concepts of respecting our government and rebelling against it. Blood Passion is an attempt to knock some of the dust off this long-forgotten yet hugely emblematic moment in American history.</p></p><h2>Angel Exterminatus (23) (Horus Heresy)</h2><p>Primarch Fulgrim leads his brother Perturabo in an attack upon a mysterious eldar world<br><br>Perturabo &#x2013; master of siegecraft, and the executioner of Olympia.

Dr. Joyce Harman, veterinarian and respected saddle&#x2013;fitting expert, claims that 75 percent of horses with such problems are simply reacting to pain caused by ill&#x2013;fitting saddles. And, as she explains in this thorough, highly illustrated book, poor saddle fit can be corrected with patience and know&#x2013;how. Here, she teaches the reader: how to determine if a saddle is sound and properly accommodates both horse and rider; how to individualize saddle fit or find a new saddle appropriate in size and style; and how to treat pre&#x2013;existing back pain and prevent its future occurrence.

The Reformers broke with the Roman Church when they answered that Christians are justified by faith alone. But evangelicals no longer seem certain about that keystone of faith.<br><br>In<i> Faith Alone</i>, a Gold Medallion finalist and Evangelical Book Club main selection, R. C. Sproul discerns a softening of the doctrine of justification and explains why Christians must return to the biblical, Reformation view. He provides biblical evidence and theological reasons why Protestantism and Roman Catholicism divided in the first place, and why that division remains an uncrossed chasm. <br><br>Now in paperback, <i>Faith Alone</i> offers a clear explanation of classic Protestant teaching on salvation, helping readers understand why this teaching is so important.<b>R.

He describes the pressing imperatives of work, food, transportation, and family obligations that led to unavoidable compromise and negotiation with the army of occupation. In the process, he sheds light on such subjects as forced labor, the role of the Catholic Church, the &#x201c;horizontal collaboration&#x201d; between French women and German soldiers, and, most surprisingly, the ambivalent attitude of ordinary people toward the Resistance. <br><br>A great work of reconstruction, <i>Marianne in Chains</i> provides a clear view, unobscured by romance or polemics, of the painful ambiguities of living under tyranny.<br><br></p><p><br>Robert Gildea is a professor of modern European history at the University of Oxford. His previous books include <i>France Since 1945 </i>and <i>The Past in French History</i>. He lives in Oxford.<br><br>Oxford historian Gildea examines the gamut of French responses to the Nazi occupation of WWII, combining archival research with interviews of some 50 ordinary men and women who survived the war in the Loire Valley. These individuals range over the entire political, religious and social spectrum of France during the occupation. Gildea is especially interested in the creation of postwar narratives about the occupation-attempts to organize memories around such themes as the noble resistance hero confronting the brutal invader or the opposite narrative of pervasive collaboration by the French. Gildea says that after the liberation, right-wing Catholics, Gaullists, the displaced bureaucrats of Vichy, the few surviving Jews and the Communists all competed for control of the occupation's history. In fact, his research shows, events during the war were not as clear-cut as the postliberation myths suggest. Instead, rather than being all heroes or all collaborators, the French had to improvise, playing an intricate (and increasingly dangerous) double game of impressing the Germans as cooperative while carving out as much autonomy as possible as conditions changed. Overall, Gildea sees the French as creative and flexible, with interest groups such as industrial workers or farmers devising strategies and building networks for self-protection. The horizons of people's loyalties shrank from the nation as a whole to the factory, the village or the family. The strength of this book lies in the author's appreciation of the complexity of people's behavior under pressure. Delving behind the postwar stereotypes, Gildea (France Since 1945) reveals the myriad paths ordinary French citizens took to survive the occupation. 16 pages of photos, 5 maps not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Lonely Planet Great Britain (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world's leading travel guide publisher</i> </p><p><b>Lonely Planet Great Britain </b>is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

This fascinating question forms the basis for Simon Greenleaf&#39;s classic study of the rules of legal evidence as applied to the New Testament accounts of the life and teaching of Jesus.Simon Greenleaf (1783-1853) was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, and began the practice of law in Portland, Maine. Serving as professor of law at Harvard University from 1833-48, he was instrumental in organizing the university's law program. His three-volume work, <i>A Treatise on the Law of Evidence</i>, in considered a classic of American jurisprudence and forms the basis for his study of the Gospels.</p><h2>Jonah (Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible)</h2><p>Pastors and leaders of the classical church--such as Augustine, Calvin, Luther, and Wesley--interpreted the Bible theologically, believing Scripture as a whole witnessed to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Modern interpreters of the Bible questioned this premise. But in recent decades, a critical mass of theologians and biblical scholars has begun to reassert the priority of a theological reading of Scripture.<br><br>The Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible enlists leading theologians to read and interpret Scripture for the twenty-first century, just as the church fathers, the Reformers, and other orthodox Christians did for their times and places. In the sixth volume in the series, Phillip Cary presents a theological exegesis of Jonah.</p><p><b>Praise for previous volumes in the Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible<br><br></b>"The significance of these commentaries and the series [they] inaugurate [is] manifold, because they promise not only to serve as a means for sifting the wheat and chaff of much recently accumulated hermeneutical theory but also to offer the commentary a place at the theological table it has had difficulty attaining in modernism. . . . [<i>Acts</i>] is a tour de force of the history of doctrine, as [Jaroslav] Pelikan draws in his lifetime to remark upon a vast panoply of subjects."--<b>Steven J. Koskie</b>, <i>Journal of Theological Interpretation<br></i><br>"[In <i>Matthew</i>, Stanley Hauerwas] continually draws Matthean motifs together with similar features in the rest of the Bible and shows where subsequent generations found the basis for their doctrinal reasoning. . . . This commentary serves readers admirably by connecting the points that lie between the first and twenty-first centuries and by reminding readers that Matthew's Gospel has played a deep, broad role in centuries of theological reflection."--<b>A. K. M. Adam</b>, <i>Christian Century<br><br></i>"[Peter] Leithart has done an admirable job [in <i>1 &amp; 2 Kings</i>]. . . . He demonstrates a breadth of reading and knowledge of theological matters and brings that knowledge to bear upon the book of Kings. . . . For the biblical scholar, this volume is a fitting reminder that the text should be read holistically and theologically. . . . For the pastor, Leithart's commentary will provide a succinct summary of each chapter or section that is most helpful in preaching through the book. For the theologian, Leithart has shown how even the book of Kings makes weighty theological statements based upon a text-imminent, Christian reading of the book. Moreover, for all, it is a delightful read."--<b>Randall L. McKinion</b>, <i>Review of Biblical Literature<br><br></i>"[<i>Acts</i>] serves as a rich storehouse of information on historical theology, providing [Jaroslav Pelikan] with the opportunity to expound on the intersections of Acts with the major teachings of the church. . . . The book will be of great value to all who are interested in the reception history of Acts and in theological interpretation of biblical texts."--<b>Shelly Matthews</b>, <i>Catholic Biblical Quarterly<br><br></i>"What's nice to see is that the individual commentators have been allowed to retain their own voices in this series; [Stanley] Hauerwas is as delightfully irascible and hard-hitting as ever. . . . Hauerwas attends to the Gospel chapter by chapter, teasing out theological themes while resisting the temptation to create a systematic Christology. He draws on theologians like Barth, Augustine, Origen and especially Bonhoeffer, whom he quotes and paraphrases often, as well as New Testament scholars and eclectic writers like Wendell Berry. Insightful and provocative, Hauerwas adds a valuable theological perspective to the Gospel of Matthew."--<i>Publishers Weekly</i>The Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible enlists leading theologians to read and interpret scripture creedally for the twenty-first century, just as the church fathers, the Reformers, and other orthodox Christians did for their times and places. <i>Jonah</i> is the sixth volume in the series.

Kendall Soulen</b>, Wesley Theological Seminary<br><br><b>Praise for previous volumes in the series<br><br></b>"The comments that [Jaroslav] Pelikan has to offer on each point [in <i>Acts</i>] are truly valuable, insightful, and clearly articulated, a masterful treatment from a true master of his discipline. . . . [The series editors] have invited a diverse range of theologians and historians of theology to this project: We await with anticipation the wide range of offerings that are sure to emerge."--<b>John Behr</b>, <i>Pro Ecclesia<br><br></i>"[Stanley Hauerwas's] considerations that connect Matthew to a contemporary audience are well-crafted, insightful, and cannot be dismissed easily. All will appreciate the conviction, clarity, and profundity with which he writes. . . . While most commentaries strive to connect contemporary readers to the first century, Hauerwas also gives heed to Matthew's vast interpretive history, a noteworthy achievement. . . . Anyone wishing to become acquainted with theological exegesis should consider this volume. Hauerwas offers a fresh perspective on Matthew that is aberrantly insightful, colorful, compelling, and powerful.

A frequent contributor to both <em>The New Yorker</em> and the <em>New York Times</em> as well as the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>Pure Drivel</em>, Martin is once again poised to capture the attention of readers with his debut novella, a delightful depiction of life and love.<br><br> The shopgirl is Mirabelle, a beautiful aspiring artist who pays the rent by selling gloves at the Beverly Hills Neiman Marcus. She captures the attention of Ray Porter, a wealthy, lonely businessman. As Ray and Mirabelle tentatively embark on a relationship, they both struggle to decipher the language of love--with consequences that are both comic and heartbreaking. Filled with the kind of witty, discerning observations that have brought Steve Martin incredible critical success, <em>Shopgirl</em> is a work of disarming tenderness.</p><p>Steve Martin's first foray into fiction is as assured as it is surprising. Set in Los Angeles, its fascination with the surreal body fascism of the upper classes feels like the comedian's familiar territory, but the shopgirl of the book's title may surprise his fans. Mirabelle works in the glove department of Neiman's, "selling things that nobody buys any more." Spending her days waiting for customers to appear, Mirabelle "looks like a puppy standing on its hind legs, and the two brown dots of her eyes, set in the china plate of her face, make her seem very cute and noticeable." Lonely and vulnerable, she passes her evenings taking prescription drugs and drawing "dead things," while pursuing an on-off relationship with the hopeless Jeremy, who possesses "a slouch so extreme that he appears to have left his skeleton at home." Then Mr. Ray Porter steps into Mirabelle's life. He is much older, rich, successful, divorced, and selfish, desiring her "without obligation." Complicating the picture is Mirabelle's voracious rival, her fellow Neiman's employee Lisa, who uses sex "for attracting and discarding men." <p> The mutual incomprehension, psychological damage, and sheer vacuity practiced by all four of Martin's characters sees <i>Shopgirl</i> veer rather uncomfortably between a comedy of manners and a much darker work. There are some startling passages of description and interior monologue, but the characters are often rather hazy types. Martin tries too hard in his attempt to write a psychologically intense novel about West Coast anomie, but <i>Shopgirl</i> is still an enjoyable, if rather light, read. <i>--Jerry Brotton</i></p><strong>Steve Martin</strong> is a celebrated writer, actor, and performer.

Ten years later, he revised his argument: we hadn't reached the end of history, he wrote, because we hadn't yet reached the end of science. Arguing that our greatest advances still to come will be in the life sciences, Fukuyama now asks how the ability to modify human behavior will affect liberal democracy. <br><br>To re-orient contemporary debate, Fukuyama underlines man's changing understanding of human nature through history: from Plato and Aristotle's belief that man had "natural ends," to the ideals of utopians and dictators of the modern age who sought to remake mankind for ideological ends. Fukuyama persuasively argues that the ultimate prize of the biotechnology revolution-intervention in the "germ-line," the ability to manipulate the DNA of all of one person's descendents-will have profound, and potentially terrible, consequences for our political order, even if undertaken by ordinary parents seeking to "improve" their children. <br><br>In <i>Our Posthuman Future</i>, our greatest social philosopher begins to describe the potential effects of exploration on the foundation of liberal democracy: the belief that human beings are equal by nature.<br> <b>Francis Fukuyama</b> is Bernard Schwartz Professor of International Political Economy at the Paul H.

Rarely has someone entering the policy arena so eloquently and precisely laid out the case for political control of emerging technology."&#x2014;<b>Robert Lee Hotz, <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>"Fukuyama gives a fascinating tour of the post-human sciences and their implications, free of the dogma from both sides of the political spectrum that has accumulated around these breakthroughs. Fukuyama accepts the premise that life-prolonging technologies will push many citizens of industrialized countries into their second century of life. But because the developing world will still be feeling the effects of its recent population explosion, the result will be a planet divided along heretofore unimaginable demographic lines, 'with Europe, Japan, and parts of North America having a median age of nearly 60 and their less-developed neighbors having median ages somewhere in their early 20s.' Fukuyama also displays a refreshing skepticism about the prospects for genetic engineering, arguing persuasively that scientists still know too little about the ways in which genes control phenotypic expression to manipulate our genetic heritage in the near future, at least where complex attributes such as intelligence or memory are concerned."&#x2014;<b>Steven Johnson, <i>The Washington Post</i></b><br><br>"Fukuyama has taken a stunning step forward with this exploration not only of the ins and outs of a designer-baby future, but also of the politics and the political philosophy of a world in which advances in biotechnology fundamentally shape who we are as human beings. If this all sounds a little rarefied for some tastes, the genius of <i>Our Posthuman Future </i>is that it brings home just how important it will be in our immediate future for ordinary people to explore such questions."&#x2014;<b><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b><br><br>"Fukuyama seeks to develop a principled middle way between the extremes of scientific libertarianism and an unrealistic idealism . . . Whether or not one accepts Fukuyama's overall argument, his practical recommendations may well hold out the best prospect for promoting a reasonable balance between a rapidly evolving field of science and the moral views of the American people."&#x2014;<b>William A. Galston, <i>The Public Interest</i></b><br><br>"In this groundbreaking inquiry, Fukuyama warns that advances in drugs and genetic engineering will allow society to control human behavior and manipulate physical characteristics&#x2014;and this power could alter our understanding of what it means to be human . . . In a contentious and fast-moving policy area, Fukuyama provides a remarkably sensible and human vision of what is at stake and what needs to be done."&#x2014;<b><i>Foreign Affairs</i></b><br><br>"A well-written and accessible discussion of advances in biotechnology and their social, ethical, legal and regulatory implications."&#x2014;<b>Dan W.

Tinkering with biology threatens to diminish</p><p>Maybe we have a future after all: <i>Our Posthuman Future</i> is political historian Francis Fukuyama's reconsideration of his 1989 announcement that history had reached an end. He claims that science, particularly genome studies, offers radical changes, possibly more profound than anything since the development of language, in the way we think about human nature. He makes his case thoroughly and eloquently, rarely dipping into philosophical or critical jargon and consistently maintaining an informal tone.<p>Fukuyama is deeply concerned about the erosion of the foundations of liberal democracy under pressure from new concepts of humans and human rights, and most readers will find some room for agreement. Ultimately, he argues for strong international regulation of human biotechnology and thoughtfully disposes of the most compelling counterarguments. While readers might not agree that we're at risk of creating Huxley's Brave New World, it's hard to deny that things are changing quickly and that perhaps we ought to consider the changes before they're irrevocable. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><b>Francis Fukuyama</b> is Bernard Schwartz Professor of International Political Economy at the Paul H.

The story unfolds as a band of homeless people cremate a beloved dog in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. When it comes to incidents like this, the authorities are willing to overlook a few broken<br>regulations. But three weeks later, after the dog's owner gets the same fiery send-off, the SFPD knows it has a serious problem on its hands. Other than the fact that they're dealing with a particularly grisly homicide, Inspector Kate Martinelli and her partner, Al Hawkin, have little else to go on. They have a homeless victim without a positive ID, a group of witnesses who have little love for the cops, and a possible suspect, known only as Brother Erasmus. Kate<br>learns that Erasmus is well-acquainted with the park's homeless and with the rarefied atmosphere of Berkeley's Graduate Theological Union, yet he remains an enigma to all. It's apparent that he is by no means crazy--but he is a fool.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate begins the frustrating task of interrogating a man who communicates only<br>through quotations. Trying to learn something of his history leads her along a twisting road to a disbanded cult, long-buried secrets, the thirst for spirituality, and the hunger for bloody vengeance.</p><p>Laurie R. King is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of a dozen Mary Russell mysteries, beginning with <i>The Beekeeper's Apprentice, </i>as well as the contemporary novels featuring Kate Martinelli, including <i>To Play the Fool, A Grave Talent</i>,<i> </i>and <i>With Child</i>. An Edgar Award winner, she lives in Northern California.King's latest once again features gay San Francisco cop Kate Martinelli, this time juggling her lover Lee's paraplegia--the result of Lee's involvement in an earlier case of Kate's--with the frustrating investigation of the death of a homeless man in Golden Gate Park. The key suspect in the murder seems to be the enigmatically charismatic Brother Erasmus, a gentle giant of a man who speaks in quotations and whose calm dignity is a beacon for San Francisco's down-and-outs. Kate's interest is piqued when she learns that Erasmus considers himself a Holy Fool, part of an obscure, semireligious order. In her efforts to learn more about the man and his background, Kate travels from the ivy towers of academe to the squalor of San Francisco's dingiest districts. King's sometimes pedantic prose worked better in <i>The Beekeeper's Apprentice</i> , but an inventive plot and strong characters make this story well worth reading. <i>Emily Melton</i></p><h2>The Lies of Locke Lamora (GollanczF.)</h2><p>An orphan's life is harsh&#x2014;and often short&#x2014;in the island city of Camorr, built on the ruins of a mysterious alien race. But born with a quick wit and a gift for thieving, Locke Lamora has dodged both death and slavery, only to fall into the hands of an eyeless priest known as Chains&#x2014;a man who is neither blind nor a priest. A con artist of extraordinary talent, Chains passes his skills on to his carefully selected "family" of orphans&#x2014;a group known as the Gentlemen Bastards. Under his tutelage, Locke grows to lead the Bastards, delightedly pulling off one outrageous confidence game after another. Soon he is infamous as the Thorn of Camorr, and no wealthy noble is safe from his sting. Passing themselves off as petty thieves, the brilliant Locke and his tightly knit band of light-fingered brothers have fooled even the criminal underworld's most feared ruler, Capa Barsavi. But there is someone in the shadows more powerful&#x2014;and more ambitious&#x2014;than Locke has yet imagined. Known as the Gray King, he is slowly killing Capa Barsavi's most trusted men&#x2014;and using Locke as a pawn in his plot to take control of Camorr's underworld. With a bloody coup under way threatening to destroy everyone and everything that holds meaning in his mercenary life, Locke vows to beat the Gray King at his own brutal game&#x2014;or die trying.</p><p>Scott Lynch, a native of St. Paul, Minnesota, is a writer of fantasy novels.<i>Chapter One<br><br>The Don Salvara Game</i><br><br>1<br><br>LOCKE LAMORA'S RULE of thumb was this: a good confidence game took three months to plan, three weeks to rehearse, and three seconds to win or lose the victim's trust forever. This time around, he planned to spend those three seconds getting strangled.<br><br>Locke was on his knees, and Calo, standing behind him, had a hemp rope coiled three times around his neck. The rough stuff looked impressive, and it would leave Locke's throat a very credible shade of red. No genuine Camorri assassin old enough to waddle in a straight line would garrote with anything but silk or wire, of course (the better to crease the victim's windpipe). Yet if Don Lorenzo Salvara could tell a fake strangling from the real thing in the blink of an eye at thirty paces, they'd badly misjudged the man they planned to rob and the whole game would be shot anyway.<br><br>"Can you see him yet? Or Bug's signal?" Locke hissed his question as lightly as he could, then made a few impressive gurgling sounds.<br><br>"No signal. No Don Salvara. Can you breathe?"<br><br>"Fine, just fine," Locke whispered, "but shake me some more. That's the convincer."<br><br>They were in the dead-end alley beside the old Temple of Fortunate Waters; the temple's prayer waterfalls could be heard gushing somewhere behind the high plaster wall. Locke clutched once again at the harmless coils of rope circling his neck and spared a glance for the horse staring at him from just a few paces away, laden down with a rich-looking cargo of merchant's packs. The poor dumb animal was Gentled; there was neither curiosity nor fear behind the milk-white shells of its unblinking eyes. It wouldn't have cared even had the strangling been real.<br><br>Precious seconds passed; the sun was high and bright in a sky scalded free of clouds, and the grime of the alley clung like wet cement to the legs of Locke's breeches. Nearby, Jean Tannen lay in the same moist muck while Galdo pretended (mostly) to kick his ribs in. He'd been merrily kicking away for at least a minute, just as long as his twin brother had supposedly been strangling Locke.<br><br>Don Salvara was supposed to pass the mouth of the alley at any second and, ideally, rush in to rescue Locke and Jean from their "assailants." At this rate, he would end up rescuing them from boredom.<br><br>"Gods," Calo whispered, bending his mouth to Locke's ear as though he might be hissing some demand, "where the hell is that damn Salvara? And where's Bug? We can't keep this shit up all day; other people do walk by the mouth of this damned alley!"<br><br>"Keep strangling me," Locke whispered. "Just think of twenty thousand full crowns and keep strangling me. I can choke all day if I have to."<br><br>2<br><br>Everything had gone beautifully that morning in the run-up to the game itself, even allowing for the natural prickliness of a young thief finally allowed a part in his first big score.<br><br>"Of course I know where I'm supposed to be when the action starts," Bug whined. "I've spent more time perched up on that temple roof than I did in my mother's gods-damned womb!"<br><br>Jean Tannen let his right hand trail in the warm water of the canal while he took another bite of the sour marsh apple held in his left. The forward gunwale of the flat-bottomed barge was a choice spot for relaxation in the watered-wine light of early morning, allowing all sixteen stone of Jean's frame to sprawl comfortably--keg belly, heavy arms, bandy legs, and all. The only other person (and the one doing all of the work) in the empty barge was Bug: a lanky, mop-headed twelve-year-old braced against the steering pole at the stern.<br><br>"Your mother was in an understandable hurry to get rid of you, Bug." Jean's voice was soft and even and wildly incongruous. He spoke like a teacher of music or a copier of scrolls. "We're not. So indulge me once more with proof of your penetrating comprehension of our game."<br><br>"Dammit," Bug replied, giving the barge another push against the gentle current of the seaward-flowing canal. "You and Locke and Calo and Galdo are down in the alley between Fortunate Waters and the gardens for the Temple of Nara, right? I'm up on the roof of the temple across the way."<br><br>"Go on," Jean said around a mouthful of marsh apple. "Where's Don Salvara?"<br><br>Other barges, heavily laden with everything from ale casks to bleating cows, were slipping past the two of them on the clay-colored water of the canal. Bug was poling them north along Camorr's main commercial waterway, the Via Camorrazza, toward the Shifting Market, and the city was lurching into life around them.<br><br>The leaning gray tenements of water-slick stone were spitting their inhabitants out into the sunlight and the rising summer warmth. The month was Parthis, meaning that the night-sweat of condensation already boiling off the buildings as a soupy mist would be greatly missed by the cloudless white heat of early afternoon.<br><br>"He's coming out of the Temple of Fortunate Waters, like he does every Penance Day right around noon. He's got two horses and one man with him, if we're lucky."<br><br>"A curious ritual," Jean said. "Why would he do a thing like that?"<br><br>"Deathbed promise to his mother." Bug drove his pole down into the canal, struggled against it for a moment, and managed to shove them along once more. "She kept the Vadran religion after she married the old Don Salvara. So he leaves an offering at the Vadran temple once a week and gets home as fast as he can so nobody pays too much attention to him. Dammit, Jean, I already know this shit. Why would I be here if you didn't trust me? And why am I the one who gets to push this stupid barge all the way to the market?"<br><br>"Oh, you can stop poling the barge any time you can beat me hand to hand three falls out of five." Jean grinned, showing two rows of crooked brawler's teeth in a face that looked as though someone had set it on an anvil and tried to pound it into a more pleasing shape. "Besides, you're an apprentice in a proud trade, learning under the finest and most demanding masters it has to offer. Getting all the shit-work is excellent for your moral education."<br><br>"You haven't given me any bloody moral education."<br><br>"Yes. Well, that's probably because Locke and I have been dodging our own for most of our lives now. As for why we're going over the plan again, let me remind you that one good screwup will make the fate of those poor bastards look sunny in comparison to what we'll get."<br><br>Jean pointed at one of the city's slop wagons, halted on a canal-side boulevard to receive a long dark stream of night soil from the upper window of a public alehouse. These wagons were crewed by petty criminals whose offenses were too meager to justify continual incarceration in the Palace of Patience. Shackled to their wagons and huddled in the alleged protection of long leather ponchos, they were let out each morning to enjoy what sun they could when they weren't cursing the dubious accuracy with which several thousand Camorri emptied their chamber pots.<br><br>"I won't screw it up, Jean." Bug shook his thoughts like an empty coin purse, searching desperately for something to say that would make him sound as calm and assured as he imagined Jean and all the older Gentlemen Bastards always were--but the mouth of most twelve-year-olds far outpaces the mind. "I just won't, I bloody won't, I promise."<br><br>"Good lad," Jean said. "Glad to hear it. But just what is it that you won't screw up?"<br><br>Bug sighed. "I make the signal when Salvara's on his way out of the Temple of Fortunate Waters. I keep an eye out for anyone else trying to walk past the alley, especially the city watch. If anybody tries it, I jump down from the temple roof with a longsword and cut their bloody heads off where they stand."<br><br>"You what?"<br><br>"I said I distract them any way I can. You going deaf, Jean?"<br><br>A line of tall countinghouses slid past on their left, each displaying lacquered woodwork, silk awnings, marble facades, and other ostentatious touches along the waterfront. There were deep roots of money and power sunk into that row of three- and four-story buildings. Coin-Kisser's Row was the oldest and goldest financial district on the continent. The place was as steeped in influence and elaborate rituals as the glass heights of the Five Towers, in which the duke and the Grand Families sequestered themselves from the city they ruled.<br><br>"Move us up against the bank just under the bridges, Bug." Jean gestured vaguely with his apple. "His Nibs will be waiting to come aboard."<br><br>Two Elderglass arches bridged the Via Camorrazza right in the middle of Coin-Kisser's Row--a high and narrow catbridge for foot traffic and a lower, wider one for wagons. The seamless brilliance of the alien glass looked like nothing so much as liquid diamond, gently arched by giant hands and left to harden over the canal. On the right bank was the Fauria, a crowded island of multitiered stone apartments and rooftop gardens. Wooden wheels churned white against the stone embankment, drawing canal water up into a network of troughs and viaducts that crisscrossed over the Fauria's streets at every level.<br><br>Bug slid the barge over to a rickety quay just beneath the catbridge; from the faint and slender shadow of this arch a man jumped down to the quay, dressed (as Bug and Jean were) in oil-stained leather breeches and a rough cotton shirt. His next nonchalant leap took him into the barge, which barely rocked at his arrival.<br><br>"Salutations to you, Master Jean Tannen, and profuse congratulations on the fortuitous timing of your arrival!" said the newcomer.<br><br>"Ah, well, felicitations to you in respect of the superlative grace of your entry into our very humble boat, Master Lamora." Jean punctuated this statement by popping the remains of his apple into his mouth, stem and all, and producing a wet crunching noise.<br><br>"Creeping shits, man." Locke Lamora stuck out his tongue. "Must you do that? You know the black alchemists make fish poison from the seeds of those damn things."<br><br>"Lucky me," said Jean after swallowing the last bit of masticated pulp, "not being a fish."<br><br>Locke was a medium man in every respect--medium height, medium build, medium-dark hair cropped short above a face that was neither handsome nor memorable. He looked like a proper Therin, though perhaps a bit less olive and ruddy than Jean or Bug; in another light he might have passed for a very tan Vadran. His bright gray eyes alone had any sense of distinction; he was a man the gods might have shaped deliberately to be overlooked. He settled down against the left-hand gunwale and crossed his legs.<br><br>"Hello to you as well, Bug! I knew we could count on you to take pity on your elders and let them rest in the sun while you do the hard work with the pole."<br><br>"Jean's a lazy old bastard is what it is," Bug said. "And if I don't pole the barge, he'll knock my teeth out the back of my head."<br><br>"Jean is the gentlest soul in Camorr, and you wound him with your accusations," said Locke. "Now he'll be up all night crying."<br><br>"I would have been up all night anyway," Jean added, "crying from the ache of rheumatism and lighting candles to ward off evil vapors."<br><br>"Which is not to say that our bones don't creak by day, my cruel apprentice." Locke massaged his kneecaps. "We're at least twice your age--which is prodigious for our profession."<br><br>"The Daughters of Aza Guilla have tried to perform a corpse-blessing on me six times this week," said Jean. "You're lucky Locke and I are still spry enough to take you with us when we run a game."<br><br>To anyone beyond hearing range, Locke and Jean and Bug might have looked like the crew of a for-hire barge, slacking their way toward a cargo pickup at the junction of the Via Camorrazza and the Angevine River. As Bug poled them closer and closer to the Shifting Market, the water was getting thicker with such barges, and with sleek black cockleshell boats, and battered watercraft of every description, not all of them doing a good job of staying afloat or under control.<br><br>"Speaking of our game," said Locke, "how is our eager young apprentice's understanding of his place in the scheme of things?"<br><br>"I've been reciting it to Jean all morning," said Bug.<br><br>"And the conclusion is?"<br><br>"I've got it down cold!" Bug heaved at the pole with all of his strength, driving them between a pair of high-walled floating gardens with inches to spare on either side. The scents of jasmine and oranges drifted down over them as their barge slipped beneath the protruding branches of one of the gardens; a wary attendant peeked over one garden-boat's wall, staff in hand to fend them off if necessary. The big barges were probably hauling transplants to some noble's orchard upriver.<br><br>"Down cold, and I won't screw it up. I promise! I know my place, and I know the signals. I won't screw it up!"<br><br>3<br><br>Calo was shaking Locke with real vigor, and Locke's performance as his victim was a virtuoso one, but still the moments dragged by. They were all trapped in their pantomime like figures out of the richly inventive hells of Therin theology: a pair of thieves destined to spend all eternity stuck in an alley, mugging victims that never passed out or gave up their money.<br><br>"Are you as alarmed as I am?" Calo whispered.<br><br>"Just stay in character," Locke hissed. "You can pray and strangle at the same time."<br><br>There was a high-pitched scream from their right, echoing across the cobbles and walls of the Temple District. It was followed by shouts and the creaking tread of men in battle harness--but these sounds moved away from the mouth of the alley, not toward it.<br><br>"That sounded like Bug," said Locke.<br><br>"I hope he's just arranging a distraction," said Calo, his grip on the rope momentarily slackening. At that instant, a dark shape darted across the gap of sky between the alley's high walls, its fluttering shadow briefly falling over them as it passed.<br><br>"Now what the hell was that, then?" Calo asked.<br><br>Off to their right, someone screamed again.<br><br>4<br><br>Bug had poled himself, Locke, and Jean from the Via Camorrazza into the Shifting Market right on schedule, just as the vast Elderglass wind chime atop Westwatch was unlashed to catch the breeze blowing in from the sea and ring out the eleventh hour of the morning.<br><br>The Shifting Market was a lake of relatively placid water at the very heart of Camorr, perhaps half a mile in circumference, protected from the rushing flow of the Angevine and the surrounding canals by a series of stone breakwaters. The only real current in the market was human-made, as hundreds upon hundreds of floating merchants slowly and warily followed one another counterclockwise in their boats, jostling for prized positions against the flat-topped breakwaters, which were crowded with buyers and sightseers on foot.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Just Another Poster?: Chicano Graphic Arts in California / Artes Graficas Chicanas en California</h2><p><i>Just Another Poster?</i> investigates the critical role posters and other graphic materials played in the Chicano struggle for self-determination in California, from the borderland of San Diego to the urban metropolis of San Francisco. This volume of essays by an interdisciplinary group of scholars and curators represents the first comprehensive study of the ways the poster, as a medium of expression largely relegated to the margins of art world display, distribution, and critical reception, has been a primary form of cultural expression within Chicano communities in California and across America.</p><p><b>Chon Noriega</b> is associate professor of film and television at the Univerity of Califonria at Los Angeles. The other contributors include Josï¿½ Montoya, George Lipsitz, Tere Romo, Holly Barnet-Sanchez, Rafael Pï¿½rez-Torres, and Carol A. Wells.This publication, which accompanies a touring exhibition organized by the University Art Museum at the University of California, Santa Barbara, sources the remarkable holdings of the California Ethnic and Multicultural Archives (CEMA), a permanent program of the university's Davidson Library. The book explores the profound role art played as a part of the Chicano movement in California and the effectiveness of the poster medium itself. The exhibition of 56 artists' works looks at Chicano graphic art since the 1960s, initially created as part of the Chicano civil rights movement. In these posters, which usually announce events or promote specific causes, artists try to recapture Mexican heritage and create Chicano identity, often using images and words from both their native and their adopted culture. The diversity of approach shows in the form and styles of the work itself, which ranges from silkscreen to digital and from traditional to postmodern pastiche. Over 30 color plates, a catalog of the exhibition, and an appendix about printmaking processes round out the text. As contributor George Lipsitz so aptly describes it: "The production of posters was not so much community-based art making as it was art-based community making."

In an over-the-top punch-up written by Duggan (Attack of the Show!) and comedian-actor Posehn, cult-favorite Deadpool gets the Marvel NOW! treatment, and this first collection does not disappoint. The premise is as simple as it is humorous: Deadpool is reluctantly commissioned by the global police force, S.H.I.E.L.D., to locate and rekill zombie presidents magically reborn, thanks to a misguided patriotic necromancer. A classic Deadpool comic comes preloaded with quips, banter, and revelry, but what makes this book truly shine is the intricate artwork by Moore (The Walking Dead, v.1, 2006). Moore&#x2019;s elaborate spreads are often full of multiple moving parts with detail to spare, but he manages it all without the art feeling cramped. Duggan and Posehn provide an undead playground for Moore to sketch, from a bare-knuckle boxing match with Abe Lincoln to a zero-gravity romp with Nixon in space. This book should come with a ripcord. --Ben Spanner</p><h2>The Black Stallion Picture Book (Illustrated with Color Photographs From The Motion Picture)</h2><p>Young Alec Ramsay is shipwrecked on a desert island with a horse destined to play an important part in his life.

The saga begins with Richard Bennett, a small-town Indiana roughneck who grew up to be one of the bright lights of the New York stage during the early twentieth century. In time, however, Richard's fame was eclipsed by that of his daughters, Constance and Joan, who went to Hollywood in the 1920s and found major success there. Constance became the highest-paid actress of the early 1930s, earning as much as $30,000 a week in melodramas. Later she reinvented herself as a comedienne in the classic comedy Topper , with Cary Grant.. After a slow start as a blonde ingenue, Joan dyed her hair black and became one of the screen's great temptresses in films such as Scarlet Street . She also starred in such lighter fare as Father of the Bride . In the 1960s, Joan gained a new generation of fans when she appeared in the gothic daytime television serial Dark Shadows . The Bennetts is also the story of another Bennett sister, Barbara, whose promising beginnings as a dancer gave way to a turbulent marriage to singer Morton Downey and a steady decline into alcoholism. Constance and Joan were among Hollywood's biggest stars, but their personal lives were anything but serene.

Tolkien responded to critics who saw The Lord of the Rings as a reaction to the Second World War. Tolkien and the Great War tells for the first time the full story of how he embarked on the creation of Middle-earth in his youth as the world around him was plunged into catastrophe. This biography reveals the horror and heroism that he experienced as a signals officer in the Battle of the Somme and introduces the circle of friends who spurred his mythology into life. It shows how, after two of these brilliant young men were killed, Tolkien pursued the dream they had all shared by launching his epic of good and evil.<br>This is the first substantially new biography of Tolkien since 1977, meticulously researched and distilled from his personal wartime papers and a multitude of other sources.<br>John Garth argues that the foundation of tragic experience in the First World War is the key to Middle-earth's enduring power. Tolkien used his mythic imagination not to escape from reality but to reflect and transform the cataclysm of his generation. While his contemporaries surrendered to disillusionment, he kept enchantment alive, reshaping an entire literary tradition into a form that resonates to this day.</p><p>Millions of new captives of the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> saga have been roped into J.R.R. Tolkien&#x2019;s fantasy world as the result of Peter Jackson&#x2019;s three-part cinematic interpretation of the great 20th century fantasy. John Garth&#x2019;s <i>Tolkien and the Great War</i> will certainly captivate an elite segment of those recent converts, but it is written more for those who have long been enthralled by Middle-earth and its fantastic denizens. While many early readers found parallels between World War II and the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> fairy-tale, Garth reaches back to World War I to find the deep roots in Middle-earth. Prior to the Great War, Tolkien was a scholar with a deep passion for language and fables. In fact, he formed a literary circle with a few friends dubbed the Tea Club and Barrovian Society. Its members had the misfortune of coming of age just as the war was reaching a fevered pitch; Tolkien, a second lieutenant in the British army, survived the bloody Battle of the Somme, which took the lives of two of his closest friends. Garth adeptly chronicles how the devastation Tolkien witnessed helped shape the mythic tale that was already brewing in his mind. Written with a seriousness one associates with the time it chronicles, <i>Tolkien and the Great War</i> is a erudite but eminently readable exploration of how the harsh reality of the early 20th century colored one of the beloved fantasies of the modern era. <i>--Steven Stolder</i>John Garth, winner of the 2004 Mythopoeic Society Scholarship Award, studied English at Oxford University and has since worked as a newspaper journalist in London. A long-standing taste for the works of Tolkien, combined with an interest in the First World War, fueled the five years of research that have gone into Tolkien and the Great War and he has drawn extensively on previously unpublished personal papers as well as Tolkien&#39;s service record and other unique military documents.</p><h2>Mama&#39;s Boy: A Story from Our Americas</h2><p><b>This heartfelt, deeply personal memoir&nbsp;explores how a celebrated filmmaker and activist and his conservative Mormon mother built&nbsp;bridges across today&#x2019;s great divides&#x2014;and how our stories hold the power to heal.</b><br><br> Dustin Lance Black wrote the Oscar-winning screenplay for <i>Milk</i> and helped overturn California&#x2019;s anti&#x2013;gay marriage Proposition 8, but as an LGBTQ activist he has unlikely origins&#x2014;a conservative Mormon household outside San Antonio, Texas. His mother, Anne, was raised in rural Louisiana and contracted polio when she was two years old. She endured brutal surgeries, as well as braces and crutches for life, and was told that she would never have children or a family. Willfully defying expectations, she found salvation in an unlikely faith, raised three rough-and-rowdy boys, and escaped the abuse and violence of two questionably devised Mormon marriages before finding love and an improbable career in the U.S. civil service.<br><br> By the time Lance came out to his mother at age twenty-one, he was a blue-state young man studying the arts instead of going on his Mormon mission.

I was thirteen years old but looked ten at best&#x2014;an agonizingly shy Texas boy with eyes like water, hair like the sun, and a tanker truck&#x2019;s worth of secrets. I was jammed in the backseat of my mom&#x2019;s masï¿½sive yellow Malibu Classic between my little brother, Todd, and our stinking cat, Airborne. My mom said we were &#x201c;on the move.&#x201d; Others would have called it &#x201c;on the run.&#x201d; <br><br> Days earlier, my family had packed up what little we had of value and vanished without notice from our lives in the Lone Star State&#x2014;leaving behind my middle school in San Antonio and our Mormon church in the Randolph Ward, heading west. My mom was behind the wheel, her hairspray-stiffened curls resting on worried shoulders as she worked the hand controls to speed up and slow down her beast of a car: a colossal artifact from a former life that now had to be wrested into submission by a woman who walked on crutches, her legs in braces, her spine fused and held together with metal bars hidï¿½den just beneath the scars that ran the length of her body.<br><br> My big brother, Marcus, sat up front beside her. His hair was just as long as hers but kissing a black leather punk-rock jacket covered in pins and buttons that shouted obscenities my mom had miraculously (if not willfully) grown blind to. He had a map spread out on his lap. We were lost. We were scared. But in good Southern, Mormon fashï¿½ion, we kept our terrors to ourselves. <br><br> Here&#x2019;s the thing: we&#x2019;d been taught our entire lives that places like Los Angeles were filled with folks who&#x2019;d traded their souls and salï¿½vation for fame, booze, drugs, cash, cars, hetero sex, group sex, and dirty, filthy faggot sex. Los Angeles was the embodiment of an unfaï¿½miliar, exotic America that we&#x2019;d been warned to avoid: liberal, often coastal, a place for sinners and moral relativists. For our ragtag family on the run, passage through this city was a test of spiritual strength. So we plugged our noses in back, Marcus did his best to navigate up front, and my tiny runaway mom rotated the hand control that turned the gear that pressed down on the gas pedal that she hoped might propel us to safety.<br><br> Two hours later, Marcus and my mom finally spotted the entrance to the 5 Freeway heading north. The terrain grew steeper as we headed into the hills and over the Grapevine, a stretch of highway out of L.A., where the snarl of traffic gave way to golden grasses, a reserï¿½voir lake, ranches, and a meadow filled with wildflowers. These were more familiar sights. This felt more like home. My mom looked up into her rearview mirror, found my eyes, and with all of her mighty love and warmth, sent me a strong, silent message: <i>You&#x2019;re safe now, my Lancer. <br></i><br> I took a breath or two, pulled out a pen and a spiral notebook, and wrote a letter to a girl back in San Antonio. She and I had recently parï¿½ticipated in a one-act drama competition. She&#x2019;d played Eve. I&#x2019;d played Adam. Her mom was our drama teacher. I described Los Angeles as the &#x201c;second gayest city in the world.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t a compliment. I was already fairly certain that San Francisco was in first position thanks to AIDS hitting the national news when Old Hollywood heartthrob Rock Hudson fell out of his closet and into his grave. Since then, even the news shows in Texas had started offering up images of emaciated gay men, most in San Francisco, but others in New York and Los Angeles, dying terrible deaths thanks to their &#x201c;lifestyle choices.&#x201d; So yes, it seemed that San Francisco was the closest to hellfire, but I was fairly certain Los Angeles wasn&#x2019;t far behind. I suppose I felt it necesï¿½sary to let someone in Texas know I&#x2019;d survived our journey through this foreign land. <br><br> But as we reached the top of a mountain, something in my God-fearing heart stirred, and I looked back toward the city. It was calling to me. If I&#x2019;m being honest, it had started calling well before we set out on this adventure. If Los Angeles was dangerous, I was curious. How true were the stories I&#x2019;d heard? Did the people there really do so many strange things to their bodies, their minds, and one another? Did they really make all of those movies and TV shows I&#x2019;d fallen in love with on the rare occasions we were allowed to watch them? And the most dangerous question of all: Did the nation&#x2019;s current teen heartthrob, Ricky Schroder, with his golden hair and ocean-blue eyes, actually live somewhere down in all that chaos? <br><br> That question, and all of its invasive roots and sticky webs, linï¿½gered longest in my mind as I watched the city glimmer and shine in the morning sun until it slowly disappeared behind a veil of blue-white smog.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Thirty years have passed since that drive, and for more than two and a half decades of that time I&#x2019;ve called this City of Angels my home, with all of its sunshine, celebrities, workers, artists, headaches, egos, booze, dreams, lies, cigarette butts, body parts, hot tubs, invitations, hangovers, trophies, and yes, reliably progressive values. And like most Angelenos, I&#x2019;ve spent much of that time in my car getting from place to place, tucked inside my bubble. Isolated. And in a hurry. <br><br> So whenever I heard a siren, I did what most Angelenos do: look forward, left, right, check my rearview mirror, and keep on driving. As an Angeleno, the last thing you want to do is tap the brake. The clock is ticking. We have places to be, coffees to order, deals to make, and great things to accomplish by lunchtime. <br><br> But something happened a few years back to strip me of that habit. I was driving home down Hollywood Boulevard when my mom called. I hit the icon on my dash to answer. She sounded gloomy and called herself a &#x201c;dinosaur&#x201d; twice. I&#x2019;d rarely heard her in such a state. I was worried. So I added a three-day layover via Dulles Airport in Virginia to my next love-fueled flight to London to see the Brit I was fast falling head over heels for. It was a little surprise visit to lift my mom&#x2019;s spirits, and a big birthday present to myself. <br><br> My mom now lived in Manassas Park, in a house built right on top of the bloodied Civil War battlefields of Bull Run, where more than twenty-four thousand soldiers gave their lives in the debate over whether all men are created equally&#x2014;a scar on our nation, remindï¿½ing us of how divided we once were, and in many ways still are. <br><br> My mom cried with joy and relief when I walked into her bedï¿½room. I spent all three days with her there. We blew out candles. We ate cake. We ordered in from a local restaurant and enjoyed our dinï¿½ners on her bedroom floor. Then I opened the presents she&#x2019;d ordered off her laptop from her perennial perch atop her bed. <br><br> She wasn&#x2019;t feeling well, but that was nothing new. For a variety of reasons, big and small, she&#x2019;d long been forced to use her not inconï¿½siderable strength to fight off this illness or that. We&#x2019;d done this ailment dance many times. We simply took advantage of her sleepï¿½less nights to share stories, watch <i>NCIS, </i>check out the Home Shopï¿½ping Network&#x2019;s jewelry specials and buy a few pairs of earrings she couldn&#x2019;t afford on a military retirement check, sneak far too many Oreo cookies, and witness a sunrise. Her spirits were lifted by the company. So were mine. <br><br> Just before I left, my stepdad arrived home from work to take her to the doctor for a checkup, and get her some antibiotics for what she felt sure was a bladder infection. Love hungry and London bound, I ordered a cab to the airport. <br><br> It was a markedly quiet ride. I don&#x2019;t remember music ever even being turned on. But then my cell phone rang. The caller ID said &#x201c;Mom.&#x201d; Nothing unusual. This was her regular call to say she missed me already, and I would say the same, because it was true. Instead, when I said hello, my stepdad&#x2019;s trembling voice rang in my ears: &#x201c;Your mother collapsed. In the garage. Her heart stopped. The medï¿½ics got here. They did CPR and revived her, but she isn&#x2019;t conscious. It&#x2019;s bad, Lance. It&#x2019;s really bad.&#x201d; <br><br> I couldn&#x2019;t process it. This was the same brave mom who had sucï¿½cessfully slayed the City of Angels years earlier with three little boys and no use of her legs. It was impossible to imagine her having to be revived by anyone. My mom was the one who kept everyone else safe and strong. Her tough, stubborn heart didn&#x2019;t need a stranger&#x2019;s help to keep going. <br><br> Choking out the words, I told the cabdriver what I&#x2019;d just heard, and bless his heart, he plowed right over the grassy center median and turned back the way we&#x2019;d come. Soon we heard the siren. Then we saw an ambulance take a left turn off of my mom&#x2019;s road, racï¿½ing away from us toward the local Manassas hospital. That&#x2019;s when I noticed that, like they did in Los Angeles, the drivers in this small, polite, Southern town mostly didn&#x2019;t bother to pull over for ambulances either. Maybe a brief pause to let it pass, then a chase to make up their lost time in its wake. As we raced to catch up, I grew more and more distressed by this surprising similarity. My mom, my best friend, my rock was inside of that ambulance fighting for her life, and even here in her treasured South, no one seemed to give a damn. Our terror was their inconvenience.<br><br> Just like my mom, when things get bad, I get quiet. The worse they get, the more silent I become. The cabdriver looked back. I hadn&#x2019;t taken more than half a breath since I told him to turn around. I must have looked like a ghost. And with far too much peace in his voice for my comfort, he said, &#x201c;What is meant to be now, will be.&#x201d; <br><br> I started to shake. Until then, I hadn&#x2019;t considered that she might die. Everything I&#x2019;d ever built was thanks to that stubborn heart of hers, and there it was, racing away from me in the back of an ambuï¿½lance. Suddenly, I didn&#x2019;t know if I&#x2019;d ever again feel the warmth of her hand, know the might of her will, or stand atop the foundation she&#x2019;d built for our family with the strength of her steel-clad spine. <br><br> My mom had grown up in the South. Louisiana and Georgia. She had been deeply religious. Baptist, then Mormon. She had worked for the U.S. military. She had voted for Ronald Reagan and Bush Senior. I now had spent decades living in that wicked city she&#x2019;d refused to let us set foot in when I was thirteen. I had gone into the arts. Heck, I&#x2019;d outright fought for progressive causes like marriage equality. To outsiders, in this day and age, my mom and I should have been eneï¿½mies. Our house should have been divided&#x2014;North versus South, red versus blue, conservative versus progressive, coasts versus mountain or plains, or however you choose to name such tribes. Instead, my mom and I fueled each other. Her oil lit my lamp, and eventually mine lit hers. The tools I learned to wield growing up in her conserï¿½vative, Christian, Southern, military home were the same ones I&#x2019;d used to wage battles that had taken me from a broken-down welfare apartment where gunfire sang me to sleep to the biggest stages in the world, and to the front row of the United States Supreme Court to fight for LGBTQ equality. <br><br> Although my mom and I had often disagreed politically and perï¿½sonally, she&#x2019;d led our family by example, instilling in us a can-do attiï¿½tude that often defied reason&#x2014;an optimism many would call foolish, ignorant, and naï¿½ve, but an optimism that occasionally shocked our neighbors and our world with its brazen veracity. She was my reason.<br><br> It&#x2019;s not something I&#x2019;ve shared until now, and I know it may sound silly to some, but I had often hoped our relationship was like a pebble thrown into a pond, breaking the surface and sending ripples to the water&#x2019;s edge. If my mom and I could set foot on the bridges between us, then perhaps our neighbors and those closest to us could too. Perhaps our diverging Americas wouldn&#x2019;t be doomed to destroy each other the way our news shows and politicians would have us believe. And perhaps more could find a higher plane than politics. <br><br> So I let the cabdriver know that I&#x2019;d pay for any ticket he got, but that if he didn&#x2019;t push his pedal to the floor, he was asking for a big old can of whoop-ass from yours truly. He didn&#x2019;t need much convincing. My red eyes had already made the stakes abundantly clear. My mom had to live. Because deep in my gut, I feared a storm was coming. Beyond the headlines of the day, I could just make out the sparks of division catching fire in the disparate places we called home, and I knew that my mom and I had much more to discover and build if we were going to help our neighbors and family weather the terrible schisms this storm would bring. <br><br> So I held my zen-like cabdriver&#x2019;s gaze until he looked back out toward the ambulance that was now racing away from us, and he hit the gas.</p><h2>The missing mummy (A to Z mysteries)</h2><p>M is for Mummy. . . .<br>It's Mummy Monday at the museum, and Dink, Josh, and Ruth Rose are excited about the new Egyptian exhibit.

Antal, a major in the US Army, makes a martial equivalent of this technique the centerpiece of a gimmicky text that's as much manual as novel. Following detailed briefings on the Abrams tank and allied matters, the author introduces young Second Lieutenant Sam Jaeger. Posted to the Middle East, where America is engaged in desert warfare with an unidentified foe, Jaeger is given command of an armor platoon that's a key element in a battalion opposed by a motorized rifle division. In due course, our hero's outfit is assigned to attack hostile forces whose position is uncertain, and Jaeger must draft operational orders for his troops. At this point, Antal's narrative begins to fragment, taking on the character of a decision tree. At various stages, readers must exercise one of the several options open to the rookie officer and proceed to the sections disclosing the outcomes of their joint decision. Those who pick the correct passages through the author's tactical thicket are rewarded by the intelligence that their choices as proxies helped Jaeger win the day and earn a battlefield promotion to captain, plus a Silver Star. By contrast, failure to show initiative and to heed a superior's intent results not only in suppositious death or capture but also an invitation to try again. As Antal makes abundantly clear in his twisty, hard-boiled plotlines, armed conflict can prove terribly unforgiving of mistakes. A professionally correct bang-you're-dead exercise whose appeal seems limited to armchair strategists, gaming buffs, and, possibly, the Soldier of Fortune crowd.

All rights reserved.</i></p><h2>Beer in the Snooker Club (Twentieth Century Lives)</h2><p>This reissue of the late Waguih Ghali's only novel makes us mourn his loss all the more keenly. A plainspoken writer of consummate wryness, grace, and humor, the Egyptian author chronicles the lives of a polyglot Cairene upper crust, shortly after the fall of King Farouk, who are thoroughly unprepared to change their neo-feudal ways. "This is the best book to date about post-Farouk Egypt."&#x2014;Sylvie Drake, <i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>Waguih Ghali was raised in Cairo, but spent much of his adult life studying and working in Britain, France, Sweden, and Germany.<i>Excerpted from the Introduction</i><br>I N T R O D U C T I O N<br><br>&#x201c;History,&#x201d; Stephen Dedalus says in Ulysses, &#x201c;is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.&#x201d; By the 1960s, this plangent cry was being echoed by many sensitive men and women in Asian and African countries that had only recently entered modern history as sovereign nation-ï¿½states. The passionate idealism of anti-ï¿½imperialist movements and the longing for justice and dignity that went into the making of many new nations had been compromised by the corruption and ineptitude of the first generation of rulers. The futile cycle of coups and countercoups, and the long game of musical chairs between military strongmen and civilian politicians, had already begun. &#x201c;The politics that came,&#x201d; writes the disenchanted Caribbean narrator of V. S. Naipaul&#x2019;s The Mimic Men (1967), &#x201c;made people aware of their pain. Later they came to see their helplessness.&#x201d; <br><br>Few people felt more vulnerable to this postcolonial chaos than members of the property-ï¿½owning classes. These local elites had prospered during European rule, often as collaborators in a system of exploitation. Educated in Western or Western-ï¿½style institutions, they had become emotionally and spiritually, as well as materially, dependent on the European metropolis, all the while growing aloof from the rest of their compatriots. After independence, they tended to see their often expensive lifestyles, no less than their power, menaced by newly assertive political movements of peasants, factory workers, and ambitious military officers. And even the most altruistic and perceptive of these native aristocrats found themselves thwarted by their remoteness from ordinary lives. <br><br>Alienation was, for them, more than a pose cheaply borrowed, along with black turtlenecks, from French existentialists. It stultified private life&#x2014;ï¿½a realm often defined by quietly desperate love affairs with European men and women&#x2014;ï¿½as well as political gestures. The Mimic Men, detailing a career &#x201c;sunk in the taint of fantasy,&#x201d; was among the extraordinary spate of novels and films in Asia, Africa, and Latin America&#x2014;ï¿½from Driss Chraï¿½bi&#x2019;s Heirs to the Past and Tayeb Salih&#x2019;s Season of Migration to the North to the film Memories of Underdevelopment by Cuban Tomï¿½s Gutiï¿½rrez Alea&#x2014;ï¿½that diagnosed the failure and premature exhaustion of the most privileged and talented young men and women before the arduous challenges of revolution, nation building, and self-ï¿½renewal. But the work of art from this era that has effortlessly assumed the authority of a classic, and has actually felt more prescient and moving since the Arab Spring, is Waguih Ghali&#x2019;s Beer in the Snooker Club.<br><br>Little is known about Ghali except that he was born into a well-ï¿½off family of Coptic Christians and seems to have known intimately the radical postures and precarious bohemianism that his only novel describes with perfectly balanced harshness and solicitude. His true literary predecessor, in many ways, is Albert Cossery, who was from a Greek Orthodox bourgeois family in Cairo and who wrote in French. Cossery denounced the modern world altogether in fictions that upheld a strategic indolence as the correct response to its imperatives to think and work hard. Even the most politicized Egyptian in Cossery&#x2019;s 1948 novel, Laziness in the Fertile Valley, wonders, &#x201c;Why did [men] have to struggle, always vicious and discontented, when the sole wisdom lay in a careless, passive attitude?&#x201d; But Ghali belonged, like his first-ï¿½person narrator, Ram, to a generation of listless youth that had been galvanized by the overthrow of Egypt&#x2019;s cravenly pro-ï¿½British monarch Farouk in 1952 and the advent of the pan-ï¿½Arab nationalist Gamal Abdel Nasser. &#x201c;The only important thing,&#x201d; Ram says, &#x201c;which happened to us was the Egyptian revolution.&#x201d; Yet, as his account goes on to show with unsentimental insight and acid humor, this was yet another revolution that&#x2014;ï¿½as Milan Kundera wrote in Life Is Elsewhere, another 1960s fiction about the fantasies of the romantic intellectual&#x2014;ï¿½had &#x201c;no desire to be examined or analyzed, it only desires that the people merge with it; in this sense it is lyrical and in need of lyricism.&#x201d; <br><br>Revolution may have been the opiate of the brighter demimonde, but Egypt in the 1950s did possess its conditions. Its cities, especially Cairo, were overwhelmed by a massive influx of people who had fled rural subsistence economies only to face unemployment and the degradation of life in slums. The national economy was dominated by a large class of coldhearted landlords, rent seekers, and businessmen who ferreted their profits abroad rather than reinvesting them in the country. One of the wonders of Beer in the Snooker Club is the delicacy with which Ghali sketches a background of deprivation and anger into the confusions of a parochial elite. In what is essentially an account of drift and futility, Ghali&#x2014;ï¿½a card-carrying Communist&#x2014;ï¿½is always clear about the fate of the insulted and injured people he wanted to care for.<br>The novel opens with Ram&#x2019;s aunt, a member of the &#x201c;cosmopolitan&#x201d; feudal class, or &#x201c;parasites,&#x201d; as Ram&#x2019;s friend Font calls them, selling surplus land to the fellaheen and &#x201c;pretending to the government she was giving the land to the poor.&#x201d; These are the Cairenes who, having migrated spiritually to the European metropolis, won&#x2019;t bother to learn Arabic and despise the celebrated singer Umm Kulthum. Ram himself is shown to be initially indifferent to the inequities of his society. &#x201c;I was neither Red, Pink, Blue, nor Black. I had no politics in me then.&#x201d; His political&#x2014;ï¿½and sentimental&#x2014;ï¿½education is initiated by Edna, a Jewish member of Cairo&#x2019;s upper class.<br><br>Unlike Ram, Edna has successfully rebelled against her comprador origins. &#x201c;I hate Egyptians of your class as much as I do my parents,&#x201d; she tells Ram. &#x201c;It was Edna who introduced me to Egyptian people,&#x201d; Ram writes, adding, &#x201c;it is rare, in the milieu in which I was born, to know Egyptians.&#x201d; He and his close friend Font hungrily start to read the books she suggests. She initiates them into the cruelties of European imperialism, and the struggles for freedom waged across the postcolonial world. &#x201c;Gradually, we began to see ourselves as members of humanity in general and not just as Egyptians.&#x201d; One symptom of political awakening in the postcolonial world during the 1950s was anti-ï¿½Americanism: Ram and Font share a &#x201c;vehement phobia towards Egyptians who read the American Time Magazine.&#x201d; When Ram&#x2019;s America-ï¿½returned cousin Mounir claims that &#x201c;American Democracy is the thing&#x201d; and pontificates about the &#x201c;Red Menace,&#x201d; he finds himself violently challenged by Edna&#x2019;s intellectual protï¿½gï¿½ Ram, who has since picked up a lot of information about the plight of blacks and Native Americans in Freedom&#x2019;s Land. <br><br>Yet Ram can&#x2019;t help sense some falsity in his new role as a firebrand, and his exposure to the big world outside Egypt also breeds a different kind of appetite for life elsewhere.<br><br>The world of ice and snow in winter and red, slanting roof-ï¿½tops was beginning to call us. The world of intellectuals and underground metros and cobbled streets and a green countryside which we had never seen, beckoned to us. The world where students had rooms and typists for girl-ï¿½friends, and sang songs and drank beer in large mugs, shouted to us. . .&nbsp;. I wanted to live. I read and read and Edna spoke and I wanted to live. I wanted to have affairs with countesses and to fall in love with a barmaid and to be a gigolo and to be a political leader to win at Monte Carlo and to be down-ï¿½and-ï¿½out in London and to be an artist to be elegant and also to be in rags.<br><br>Some of these exuberant and contradictory desires are actually fulfilled as Edna helps Ram and his friend Font travel to England&#x2014;&#x201c;Jesus, Font; here we are, London and everything&#x201d;&#x2014;and Ram turns out to have a better time of it than most other people from the colonies. As an exotic, he finds himself quickly adopted by a left-ï¿½leaning English family in Hampstead. His superior class and education and fair skin help him transcend the racism that most other colonials are subjected to. So he can pity rather than despise the uneducated former soldier in Kilburn who calls Egyptians &#x201c;wogs,&#x201d; and even find it &#x201c;natural&#x201d; to sleep with the Englishman&#x2019;s fiancï¿½e. He has the upper hand on the condescending white woman who tries to pigeonhole him as one of the &#x201c;intelligent Egyptians&nbsp;. . . at the Gezira Sporting Club.&#x201d; Worried that he is turning into a &#x201c;phoney&#x201d; like his shiftless compatriots, &#x201c;the Cairo arties, who if not slumming in Europe, are driving their Jaguars in Zamalek,&#x201d; he imagines being &#x201c;down-ï¿½and-ï¿½out&#x201d; in the East End before deciding against the idea. He ends up with a compromise in Battersea, living with a working-ï¿½class man and his Irish stepfather. <br><br>Ghali recounts these adventures in Englishness with bittersweet comedy: the lonely London bedsits we know from the novels of Patrick Hamilton and Muriel Spark are suffused here with the hopefulness and energy of the deracinated colonial, who has been made to wait too long for life to begin elsewhere. To a man like Ram, conditioned by his provincial background and education to revere the metropolis, London represents all the unalloyed and thrilling glamour of metropolitan modernity; indeed, England on the whole turns out to embody the coherent world of Europe, where, unlike in Egypt, words hadn&#x2019;t drifted free from their meanings: &#x201c;where miners were communists and policemen fascists; where there was something called the &#x2018;bourgeoisie&#x2019; and someone called the &#x2018;landlady.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>But the West, so seductive with its ever-ï¿½renewed promise of pleasure and stability, remains a source of ambivalence to Ram. When in 1956 Britain tries, in a fit of neo-ï¿½imperialist delirium, to militarily seize control over the Suez Canal, Ram is further radicalized. <br><br>In spite of all the books we had read demonstrating the slyness and cruelty of England&#x2019;s foreign policy, it took the Suez war to make us believe it. Of course the Africans and the Asians had had their Suezes a long time before us&nbsp;. . . over and over again.<br><br>Ram joins the Communist Party. But he can&#x2019;t avoid the suspicion that he is not a political animal. He wonders to Edna if he is just someone who likes to &#x201c;gamble and drink and make love.&#x201d; Constantly remaking himself to suit other&#x2019;s people expectations in London, he also comes to feel an inner incoherence&#x2014;ï¿½the distinctive &#x201c;panic,&#x201d; as the dandyish narrator of Naipaul&#x2019;s The Mimic Men precisely defines it, &#x201c;of ceasing to feel myself as a whole person&#x201d; and of failing to &#x201c;fashion order out of all these unrelated adventures and encounters, myself never the same, never even the thread on which these things were hung.&#x201d; Ram is appalled to discover that he is developing a split: between the external doer and the inner observer, &#x201c;the one participating and the other watching and judging.&#x201d; More disturbing, he finds that &#x201c;there is a touch of gimmick in whatever I do.&#x201d; Even his professions of love for Edna are haunted by an oppressive sense of dï¿½jï¿½ vu: &#x201c;a scene probably already encountered in a film or a play.&#x201d; He can&#x2019;t get rid of the feeling that &#x201c;I have lost my natural self. I have become a character in a book.&#x201d; <br><br>This loss of spontaneous feeling would seem less consequential&#x2014;ï¿½a personal flaw at most&#x2014;ï¿½if it didn&#x2019;t also preclude original thinking in a postcolonial society still ruled by nostrums imported from abroad. &#x201c;The revolt of the Third World,&#x201d; Octavio Paz once warned, &#x201c;has degenerated into different varieties of frenzied Caesarism or languishes beneath the stranglehold of bureaucracies that are both cynical and fuzzy-ï¿½minded.&#x201d; New nation-ï¿½states had become prone to despotism largely because the revolt against the West had &#x201c;not discovered its proper form&#x201d;&#x2014;ï¿½ideas and institutions suited to indigenous realities. Its political and intellectual leaders suffered from a &#x201c; &#x2018;split personality,&#x2019; or in moral terms, &#x2018;inauthenticity.&#x2019; &#x201d; They invoked &#x201c;modern ideas&#x201d;&#x2014;ï¿½revolution, freedom, democracy, socialism, industrialization, mass literacy&#x2014;ï¿½but &#x201c;these ideas in many cases have been mere superficial borrowings: they have not been instruments of liberation but masks. Like all masks, their function is to shield us from the gaze of others, and, by a circular process that has often been described, to shield us from our own gaze.&#x201d; <br><br>Ram is aware that he must find a life for himself; but, sunk in the taint of colonial fantasy, and obscured by the masks of modern ideas, this basic task of self-ï¿½definition is harder for him than for the Egyptian people he seeks to represent. Yes, he has joined the Communist Party, but, as he admits, only because he can&#x2019;t do anything else with his knowledge of suffering and injustice. Returning to Egypt, where the parasites, it turns out, &#x201c;hadn&#x2019;t been dealt a heavy blow by the revolution,&#x201d; the fellaheen remain exposed to exploitation, communists have been imprisoned, and Edna has become victim to the bigotry that would soon rid Cairo of most of its Jewish, Greek, and Armenian population, Ram and Font drift into another kind of playacting: this time, as superfluous intellectuals. <br><br>Font finds a job &#x201c;brushing the snooker tables with the Literary Supplement.&#x201d; Ram tries his hand at human-rights activism. But no newspaper wants to publish his evidence of torture in Egyptian prisons. Furthermore, Ram has &#x201c;the terrible feeling that some of the pictures wouldn&#x2019;t be so gory if we didn&#x2019;t pay for them.&#x201d; His most sincere act seems to be drinking homemade &#x201c;Bass&#x201d;&#x2014;ï¿½a cocktail of the Egyptian beer Stella, vodka, and whisky&#x2014;ï¿½in a snooker club, or trying to ï¿½pater le bourgeois by pushing Mounir, the slick America-ï¿½phile, into the swimming pool of the Gezira Sporting Club. Even the anti-ï¿½Americanism is now a brittle affair, undermined by the irrecoverable colonial&#x2019;s self-ï¿½pity: &#x201c;We&#x2019;re so English it is nauseating. We have no culture of our own.&#x201d; &#x201c;The mental sophistication of Europe,&#x201d; Ram concludes, &#x201c;has killed something good and natural in us, killed it for good&nbsp;. . . for ever.&#x201d; He even longs for the &#x201c;blissful ignorance&#x201d; of the time before he met Edna. &#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t it nice to go to the Catholic church with my mother before I ever heard of Salazar or of the blessed troops to Ethiopia?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I never realized I had made you so lonely,&#x201d; says Edna, and this impossible love between a radical Jewish woman and a Coptic intellectual manquï¿½, both abandoned by history as well as by their gods, is the aching heart of this novel. However psychologically damaged and denuded of genuine emotion, Ram achieves a tragic intensity in his feelings for Edna: &#x201c;I saw her bullied by nationalities and races and political events and revolutions and dictatorships and particularly by her own vague idealism. I held her tenderly in my arms and also saw my own shallowness and unworthiness in contrast to her deepness and sincerity.&#x201d;<br><br>But Ram is also aware that he is &#x201c;never really natural&#x201d; with Edna, and she knows he won&#x2019;t be happy with her. As the novel ends, Ram moves to marry a rich heiress he has flirted with previously. He confesses he wants to live in a &#x201c;beautiful house with lots of books bound in leather.&#x201d; &#x201c;You know me better,&#x201d; he finds himself saying, &#x201c;than to think I&#x2019;d sacrifice my comfort or life or anything.&#x201d; This may seem an excessively cynical and dramatic conversion to bourgeois ease. But Ram is acting out what to u...</p><h2>Stanzas: Word and Phantasm in Western Culture (Volume 69) (Theory and History of Literature)</h2><p>&#34;Stanzas&#34; (which means &#34;rooms&#34; in Italian) is a blend of philology, the psychoanalysis of toys, medieval physics and psychology, and contemporary linguistics and philosophy. In this work, Giorgio Agamben attempts to reconfigure the epistemological foundation of Western culture. He rereads Freud and Saussure to discover the impossibility of metalanguage - there is no &#34;superior language&#34; that can read the obscure scenes of the unconscious, and the &#34;symbol&#34; is always the return of the repressed in an improper signifier. This impossibility leads Agamben to the problem of representation. He argues that since language is the locus of the production and storage of phantasms, all real objects are fractured by phantasmic itineraries that in turn divide poetry and philosophy, joy and knowledge. This division is at the origin of Western culture and renders impossible the possession of any object of knowledge. Giorgio Agamben is the author of &#34;Language and Death&#34; (University of Minnesota Press 1991).</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Italian</p><h2>Don&#39;t Fall Apart on Saturdays!

The late Vladimir Nabokov requested that this unfinished work be destroyed, but his son, Dmitri, did not oblige, although neither did he allow the work to be published - until now. &#34;The Original of Laura&#34; is about a wonderfully large man called Philip Wild, married to a very promiscuous woman, and whose meditations concern the nature of death. The novel was complete in Nabokov&#39;s mind, though he died before he could translate his vision on to paper. It is hard, however, to imagine any scholars, Nabokov enthusiasts or literature lovers being disappointed by even these fragments.</p><p><strong>Book Description</strong><br> When Vladimir Nabokov died in 1977, he left instructions for his heirs to burn the 138 handwritten index cards that made up the rough draft of his final and unfinished novel, <em>The Original of Laura</em>. But Nabokov&#x2019;s wife, Vera, could not bear to destroy her husband&#x2019;s last work, and when she died, the fate of the manuscript fell to her son. Dmitri Nabokov, now seventy-five--the Russian novelist&#x2019;s only surviving heir, and translator of many of his books--has wrestled for three decades with the decision of whether to honor his father&#x2019;s wish or preserve for posterity the last piece of writing of one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century. His decision finally to allow publication of the fragmented narrative--dark yet playful, preoccupied with mortality--affords us one last experience of Nabokov&#x2019;s magnificent creativity, the quintessence of his unparalleled body of work. <p></p> <p><em>Photos of the handwritten index cards accompany the text.

Nef Distinguished Service Professor and a member of the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago. He is a graduate of the Western New England Institute for Psychoanalysis and was trained in philosophy at the University of Cambridge and Rockefeller University. Before going to Chicago, he taught at Yale University and the University of Cambridge, where he was a fellow and director of Studies in Philosophy at Clare College. He is also the author of <i>Open Minded: Working Out the Logic of the Soul, Aristotle: The Desire to Understand, and </i><i>Aristotle and Logical Theory.</i>This simply written and accessible book seeks to define and identify love as a force, central to human nature, that is at the root of Freudian theory. To accomplish this aim, the author proceeds to explicate basic psychoanalytic concepts in a lucid and compelling manner, convincingly arguing for a psychological rather than a biological root and correspondingly love rather than sex and aggression as a central motivator in Freudian theory. As a philosopher conversant with analytic theory, the author also advocates a view of humanity as needing to discover its archaic unconscious, an area often neglected by more rationally focused philosophers. Psychological theorists might question the author's neglect of neo-Freudians such as Fromm who have focused on love but have seemed less committed to retaining a Freudian viewpoint. But lay readers as well as scholars will benefit from his clear presentation of psychoanalysis and his unique vantage point.<br><i>- Paul Hymowitz, New York Medical Coll.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Northern Light</h2><p><b>Carnegie Medal Winner, United Kingdom<br>Los Angeles Times Book Prize Winner&nbsp;</b><b>One of TIME Magazine's 100 Best Young Adult Books of All Time&nbsp;<br>Borders 2004 Original Voices Award Winner <br>Named a Best Book of 2003 by Publishers Weekly, Booklist, School Library Journal, The Irish Times, The Times (London), The Financial Times and The Albany Times-Union.</b><br><br>Sixteen-year-old Mattie Gokey has big dreams but little hope of seeing them come true.

But when Grace's drowned body is fished from the lake, Mattie discovers that the letters could reveal the grim truth behind a murder.<br><br>Set in 1906 against the backdrop of the murder that inspired Theodore Dreiser's <i>An American Tragedy,</i> Jennifer Donnelly's astonishing debut novel effortlessly weaves romance, history, and a murder mystery into something moving, and real, and wholly original.<br><br><i>Includes a reader's guide and an interview with the author.</i></p><p>It's 1906 and 16-year-old Mattie Gokey is at a crossroads in her life. She's escaped the overwhelming responsibilities of helping to run her father's brokedown farm in exchange for a paid summer job as a serving girl at a fancy hotel in the Adirondacks. She's saving as much of her salary as she can, but she's having trouble deciding how she's going to use the money at the end of the summer. Mattie's gift is for writing and she's been accepted to Barnard College in New York City, but she's held back by her sense of responsibility to her family--and by her budding romance with handsome-but-dull Royal Loomis. Royal awakens feelings in Mattie that she doesn't want to ignore, but she can't deny her passion for words and her desire to write. <p> At the hotel, Mattie gets caught up in the disappearance of a young couple who had gone out together in a rowboat. Mattie spoke with the young woman, Grace Brown, just before the fateful boating trip, when Grace gave her a packet of love letters and asked her to burn them. When Grace is found drowned, Mattie reads the letters and finds that she holds the key to unraveling the girl's death and her beau's mysterious disappearance. Grace Brown's story is a true one (it's the same story told in Theodore Dreiser's <i>An American Tragedy</i> and in the film adaptation, <i>A Place in the Sun</i>), and author Jennifer Donnelly masterfully interweaves the real-life story with Mattie's, making her seem even more real. </p><p> Mattie's frank voice reveals much about poverty, racism, and feminism at the turn of the twentieth century. She witnesses illness and death at a range far closer than most teens do today, and she's there when her best friend Minnie gives birth to twins. Mattie describes Minnie's harrowing labor with gut-wrenching clarity, and a visit with Minnie and the twins a few weeks later dispels any romance from the reality of young motherhood (and marriage). Overall, readers will get a taste of how bitter--and how sweet--ordinary life in the early 1900s could be. Despite the wide variety of troubles Mattie describes, the book never feels melodramatic, just heartbreakingly real.

Distinguished by its author's masterly style and command of detail, The End of the Twentieth Century is a startling examination of where we are today, how we got here, and where we are headed.<br>Centering on Europe, America, and the relations between the two, Lukacs argues that the major battle of our time has been waged between forms of nationalism rather than between communism and democracy; that the great watershed events have been the two world wars, not the Russian Revolution; and that the century's radical revolutionary was neither Lenin nor Chairman Mao but Adolf Hitler. The book puts into sharp perspective such events as the collapse of the Soviet Union, the civil war raging in what was Yugoslavia, and the resurgence of right-wing politics in a reunited Germany. Rather than the end of history, we are now witnessing the end of the modern era, and what awaits us is not the triumphal reign of liberal democracy but a troubled time that may echo much that is most questionable in our age.<br>Informed by the precision and insight that have made Lukacs a leading historian, The End of the Twentieth Century is a reckoning both personal and professional - at once a brilliant rebuttal to Francis Fukuyama's The End of History and an outstanding, if sobering, work of historical mediation.</p><p>Lukacs begins these highly personal reflections on current history by stating, "the main political force in the twentieth century has been nationalism, not Communism." Hitler, not Lenin or Mao, is the great revolutionary of the century, he argues; Western liberalism's enemies borrowed from the Fuhrer their reliance on a radical and exclusionist nationalism. Populist nationalism remains a potent mixture, especially in Eastern Europe, where it "is the only religion that still possesses a functional rhetoric." Part history, part memoir, this book, parts of which appeared in Harper's , will appeal to general reader and scholar alike. Those who have read other works by Ingersoll Prize-winner Lukacs (most recently, The Duel , Ticknor &amp; Fields, 1991) will not be disappointed; a catholic reading of history leads to piquant and highly original observations on many topics of current concern. More modest in aim than Francis Fukuyama's The End of History and the Last Man ( LJ 1/92), Lukacs's book is also more solid.<br><i>- David Keymer, California State Univ., Stanislaus</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.While "the twentieth century was the American Century," distinguished historian Lukacs contends that the 21st century is not likely to be dominated by U.S. interests. From his perspective, the end of the modern age is at hand, as superpower politics gives way to resurgent nationalism and the authority of centralized goverments declines. In these brilliant, often unorthodox historical reflections, Lukacs assesses the overwhelming impact of Hitler and two world wars on our century. He asserts that the Cold War began winding down in 1956, and that it was the result of a reciprocal misunderstanding between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. In both East and West, he finds overextended, heavily bureaucratized regimes vacillating atop societies whose social mortar--civility, morals, common sense, law--is crumbling. Lukacs joins these musings with personal impressions of a visit to Hitler's birthplace, a 1990 White House dinner and his recent bittersweet return trips to his native Hungary, which he fled in 1946. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Load &amp; resistance factor design : manual of steel construction.</h2><p>Manuals of Steel Construction</p><p></p><h2>The Summoning God (The Anasazi Mysteries, Book 2)</h2><p>Step back into the year A.D. 1263...and the secret lair of a killer.

What Dusty and Maureen discover about the killer's methods is almost too horrible to believe.<br><br>From the national award-winning archaeologist and international bestselling author of <i>The Vistant</i> comes a novel of unforgettable terror about mass murder in America eight hundred years ago...<br></p><p>Book two in the Anasazi Mysteries series, <i>The Summoning God</i> is the sequel to <i>The Visitant</i>, in which archaeologist-authors Kathleen O'Neal Gear and W. Michael Gear introduced readers to murder, mayhem, and the myriad details of life in a 13th-century Native American pueblo. In both novels, the narrative arcs between the present and the past, drawing aside the seemingly thin veil of time that separates them. Here, as archaeologists Dusty Stewart and Maureen Cole sift through an ancient Anasazi kiva, attempting to understand the circumstances that could have led to the presence of 33 charred children's bodies in the ceremonial chamber, we also see the members of the pueblo as they move toward the terrible destruction so carefully unearthed by Stewart and Cole. This narrative device isn't revolutionary, but it <i>is</i> clever: the demands of classic mystery plotting (we have a corpse, but who committed the crime?) are fulfilled, while the reader lives simultaneously in the worlds of evidence creation and deduction.<p> The Anasazi characters will be familiar to readers of <i>The Visitant</i>: warriors Browser and Catkin, holy men Springbank and Stone Ghost, and the witch Two Hearts continue to move silently through the sand and sagebrush, circling through a world marked by warring religions and vanishing resources. When Browser and Catkin find a mutilated old woman surrounded by the skulls of her clan, they must summon all their courage to combat what surely must be witchcraft--or is it? Although the narrative founders at times in a sea of murkily presented myth, the characters are vibrantly drawn (though to watch an Anasazi holy man conduct an autopsy in a manner that would do Kay Scarpetta proud is one of several discordant anachronisms).</p><p> <i>The Summoning God</i>, like its predecessor, renders the lives and habits of the Anasazi in compelling detail: we learn that they used blazing star petals for perfume and that their ceremonial purification rites included cornmeal and ground seashells. Though the tenacity with which the authors seek to hammer home a situational equivalency between modern life and the 13th century is sometimes painfully heavy-handed, the evocation of daily life never is. Readers might wish to acknowledge that overutilization of resources, a thirst for territory, and a propensity toward holy wars are indeed threads that bind us to the Anasazi--then ignore the lectures and settle into the story. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>11 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Tuesday Club Murders: A Miss Marple Mystery (Agatha Christie Collection)</h2><p>The unifying premise for this short story collection is the Tuesday Club: six people who meet socially one evening at Jane Marple&#39;s home and then decide to meet regularly each Tuesday night to solve a mystery which a group member must relate.</p><p>Agatha Christie was born in 1890 and created the detective Hercule Poirot in her debut novel, <i>The Mysterious Affair at Styles</i> (1920).

A French Jew who broke with Judaism and wavered on the brink of Roman Catholicism, the daughter of a respected French physician, the sister of one of this century&#39;s great mathematicians, Simone Weil devoted herself to a pilgrimage in search of truth and God amid the poverty and misery of the poor. This frail woman&#39;s passionate search led her from her life as a brilliant student of philosophy to her jobs in the 1930s as an unskilled worker in factories, her enlistment with the Spanish Loyalists, her work in trade unions, and to her confrontation with the crisis of contemporary religious and scientific faith. Her struggle to understand these experiences was expressed in some of the most penetrating literary, political, and philosophical essays of this century. A generation of intellectuals, including T.S. Eliot, Martin Buber, Dwight MacDonald, and Susan Sontag, has been fascinated and haunted by this French saint-philosopher-activist.&#34;</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>EMPIRE OF THE CZAR</h2><p>Details the personalities and workings of Russian society and the court at the time of Emperor Nicholas I</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Blind In One Ear</h2><p>The star of the 1960s TV series &#34;The Avengers&#34; recalls his unusual childhood and familial relationships and the adventures and misadventures of his later life as a celebrity</p><p>To the stereotypic British school boyhood of beatings and homosexual encounters, add a lesbian mother, an "Uncle Evelyn," and an absent alcoholic racehorse trainer father, and you have Macnee's almost gothic horror of a childhood.

The Hills hold everything she desires: her family; her beloved dog, Aerlich - and soon, her fiancï¿½, Donal, who has been away for a year. But one evening a lamb is lost. And when Maddy returns to the Hills to find it, she discovers something else the Hills possess - something that will change her forever...<br></p><p>Maddy has lost her sheep and even her dog Aerlich doesn't know where to find him.

Okay, so Newbery Medal winner Robin McKinley's magical story <i>The Stone Fey</i> is no Little Bo Peep tale, and Maddy, the conflicted, passionate shepherdess, is no Bo Peep. One wild night in the Hills of Damar, a stone fey--a magical creature of the wilds--greets Maddy with her lost lamb in his muscular arms--his skin was gray, with "a rose-quartz flush across his cheekbones."

Too often, controversies are borne unnecessarily. Like publicity stunts. Why? Because those involved don&#39;t have the facts. Their critique is based on hearsay and opinion. Unfortunately, this happens every day, through virtually every media outlet known. Nonetheless, Grand Illusions represents a controversy based on fact. Ironically all of the material in this book comes directly from Planned Parenthood - from their own files and records. Grand Illusions tells the whole story of this insidiously vile organization. The irrefutable, documented purpose for its funding, the testimony of young teenagers and clinic patients, and actual clinic visit records - complete with sobering statistics. In this revised and updated edition, historian and political theorist George Grant documents the sordid truths and fraudulent tactics of one of America&#39;s most &#34;politically correct&#34; institutions.

Mary Ann, always a bit of a rebel, is looking to offer a more progressive voice in the staunchly conservative town at Christmastime and has a few ideas up her red velvet sleeves.</p><p>GREG KINCAID, author of A Dog Named Christmas and Christmas with Tucker, is a practicing lawyer in Kansas who helped to start the Changing Lives Through Literature Program and has served as the chairman of the Optimist Oratory Contest for the past seven years. The father of five children, he lives on a farm in western Johnson County, Kansas, with his wife and two dogs.<p>1</p><p>Mary Ann McCray had been on the board of the Crossing Trails Public Library for what she considered to be too many years. Like most small Kansas towns, Crossing Trails was losing population. With a shrinking tax base, the library struggled for funding. Mary Ann was not sure she understood the other board members. They seemed too easily diverted from their primary mission, fostering literacy, as well as raising the money, volunteers, and awareness to support that cause. The problem was serious. Not only was there not enough money, but people weren&#x2019;t reading like they used to.</p><p>The use of the library was shifting, too. It was easy to measure. Book loans were down, but they did a booming business in DVDs, CDs, and video games. The demographics were changing before their eyes. The patrons of the library were older, like her, and the young people who did come in seemed to be there for the free Internet access. They needed to get kids reading books, in her opinion. As a longtime teacher in Crossing Trails, she believed with all her heart that books ignited a passion for learning.</p><p>But other issues seemed to continually divert the board&#x2019;s attention, including today&#x2019;s topic. Mary Ann had tried to keep quiet, not make waves, but this latest discussion was upsetting, particularly because it involved one of her oldest and closest friends. She leaned forward and raised her palm, like a conversational traffic cop. &#x201c;I disagree, totally. We don&#x2019;t need to do this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; one board member asked. Carol Sampson seemed surprised that something so simple as finding a new Santa Claus for the library&#x2019;s annual holiday program would prompt such a reaction.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a matter of loyalty. Hank Fisher&#x2019;s been playing Santa for us for forty years. We never paid him a dime, and he&#x2019;s never asked for a thing in return. It&#x2019;s an important part of who we are--part of our tradition.&#x201d; Mary Ann tried to check her indignation before adding, &#x201c;I just can&#x2019;t imagine Christmas or Crossing Trails without Hank as our Santa.&#x201d; She thought for a moment about dear Hank, whom she&#x2019;d known since she was a little girl. True, Hank was over eighty, but asking him to hang up his Santa suit after all these years--it didn&#x2019;t sit well with her.</p><p>&#x201c;I disagree,&#x201d; Marsha Thompson, the youngest board member, countered. &#x201c;Our responsibility is to the library and the children of this community, not Hank Fisher. I hate to sound harsh, but children shouldn&#x2019;t have to see Santa in a wheelchair or with oxygen tubes up his nose. They&#x2019;ll worry that Santa might not make it to Christmas.&#x201d;</p><p>Another member, Catherine Evans, also spoke out. &#x201c;Marsha is exaggerating. Hank doesn&#x2019;t always need oxygen and isn&#x2019;t in the wheelchair all the time, but here&#x2019;s the real point--Hank isn&#x2019;t the tradition, Santa is the tradition. Sooner or later Hank has to retire, and maybe the time has come.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I agree,&#x201d; the head librarian, Tammy Larson, gently interjected, her tone kind, &#x201c;but before we ask Hank to step down, shouldn&#x2019;t we find someone else willing to do it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lots of people could do it.&#x201d; Marsha looked back to Mary Ann. &#x201c;How about your son, Todd? He&#x2019;s back in town, right? Let&#x2019;s put a fresh face on Santa. He&#x2019;d be a great Santa. Or your husband, George? He could do it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Todd&#x2019;s just now moving back, and all his spare time is taken up with the new animal shelter. And as for George . . . well, he&#x2019;s not all that fresh!&#x201d; The board members chuckled a bit, but Mary Ann shook her head soberly. &#x201c;Besides, George wouldn&#x2019;t take this away from Hank.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I adore Hank,&#x201d; said Louisa Perkins, a longtime friend of Mary Ann&#x2019;s. &#x201c;We all do, but he&#x2019;s so fragile. If we can&#x2019;t find a volunteer, maybe it would be best if we just hired someone to do it. That way we&#x2019;re certain that Santa has been professionally trained and vetted. You can&#x2019;t be too careful these days.&#x201d;</p><p>Refusing to give up on Hank, Mary Ann argued, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think this has anything to do with Hank&#x2019;s health or how an aged Claus might affect the children in our community. Having a thin old man dressed in a red suit just upsets our vision of what we think Santa should look like. The kids won&#x2019;t care a bit. We should just get over it and let Hank do his job for as long as he&#x2019;s willing to do it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure we could all be pretty flexible on Santa&#x2019;s appearance,&#x201d; Catherine Evans observed. &#x201c;I really don&#x2019;t think appearances are the issue.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Mary Ann echoed, incredulous. &#x201c;Are you so sure?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. I&#x2019;m sure,&#x201d; Catherine responded. &#x201c;This has absolutely nothing to do with appearances.&#x201d;</p><p>She might have spent the last thirty years as a guidance counselor and music teacher at the Crossing Trails High School, but the activity that Mary Ann enjoyed most was coaching the debate team. If nothing else, she knew how to argue. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m right about this. I&#x2019;m telling you, it&#x2019;s all about appearances.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why do you say that?&#x201d; Catherine asked, worrying that the increasingly uncomfortable conversation was about to become quite heated.</p><p>Mary Ann set her pen down on her pad of paper. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m willing to go meet with Hank and tell him that his forty-two years as Crossing Trails&#x2019; St. Nick is about to come to an end, not because he looks too old and feeble--because, we all know, appearances don&#x2019;t matter. It&#x2019;s just that we&#x2019;ve decided to go in a different direction this year.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; Arthur Lee prodded. Arthur was the only male board member, and he was also the chair. He&#x2019;d been silent up to now, willing to hear out Mary Ann&#x2019;s point of view but also unsure of how to reach a compromise on something that suddenly seemed more complicated than just picking a new Santa.</p><p>Mary Ann held everyone&#x2019;s attention now. &#x201c;Instead of Hank doing it,&#x201d; she began, pulling the reductio ad absurdum argument directly from her debate playbook and pausing for effect, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do it.&#x201d;</p><p>The room went quiet as each board member wondered if Mary Ann McCray was serious or just being contrary. Every person would agree she was a major asset to the board, but from time to time she showed her prickly side.</p><p>She continued, &#x201c;Think about it. Mr. Claus is tired. He needs to take this year off. Santa has no 401(k), so he can never retire. He&#x2019;s been doing this for a few hundred years. Never complains about his bad back or the arthritis in his fingers. The man needs a break. This year he sent Mrs. Claus to Crossing Trails. Women do the shopping, wrap the gifts, and do the decorating, right? They can wipe children&#x2019;s noses, change their diapers, so I suppose they can take gift orders from adoring children. That&#x2019;s the easiest part of Christmas. I&#x2019;ll do it. Do you want me to be Santa Claus instead of Hank? Appearance isn&#x2019;t the issue. Right?&#x201d;</p><p>There was a long silence as everyone in the room tried to take in her point. Arthur Lee wasn&#x2019;t sure what to think. There was something rather clever about the idea, but at the same time he wasn&#x2019;t sure it added up. &#x201c;Well, that certainly would be going in a different direction, but don&#x2019;t you think that children are accustomed to seeing Santa as a grandfatherly figure? Would they be disappointed?&#x201d;</p><p>Placing her hands flat on the conference-room table and leaning in, Mary Ann said, &#x201c;Crossing Trails--the only town in America that Mrs. Claus cared enough to visit. It wasn&#x2019;t easy, but she left her cozy kitchen at the North Pole, took off her apron, and came to see us. Aren&#x2019;t we lucky?&#x201d;</p><p>Marsha Thompson, jumping in to break the tension, quipped, &#x201c;The elves will revolt--who&#x2019;ll do the laundry?&#x201d;</p><p>Catherine laughed but then said, &#x201c;I thought it was supposed to be Santa Claus, not . . . Anna Claus.&#x201d;</p><p>Mary Ann could not help crowing. &#x201c;See, that&#x2019;s my point! It is about appearances. It&#x2019;s hard for us to envision Santa as anything but a robust old man with twinkling blue eyes. So what if he&#x2019;s getting older? What difference does it make? Don&#x2019;t we all get older, just like Hank Fisher has? It&#x2019;s not how Santa looks, it&#x2019;s what he does that matters, and Hank is a great Santa.&#x201d;</p><p>As he cleared his throat, all eyes turned to Arthur Lee. Mary Ann was confident that she&#x2019;d won the argument and that Arthur would side with her--Hank could keep his job, at least for now. She&#x2019;d always found Arthur to be a very reasonable man. There was no reason to believe that today would be any different.</p><p>He began to speak. &#x201c;I have a twelve-year-old daughter. Most of you know Lilly. I think she&#x2019;s pretty special.&#x201d; His face seemed to light up at the mere mention of his daughter&#x2019;s name. He continued, &#x201c;I want Lilly to believe that she can be anything she wants. I read once that traditions are not so much abandoned as disregarded--like bobbing for apples--because they don&#x2019;t change with the times. Mary Ann, I think you&#x2019;re right. We&#x2019;ve ignored the other partner in the Claus family for too long. I think you&#x2019;ve stumbled across a novel and intriguing idea whose time has come. Why not extend Anna Claus an invitation to visit Crossing Trails for Christmas? Let&#x2019;s have fun with it. Let&#x2019;s do press releases. Let&#x2019;s put Crossing Trails and Mrs. Claus both back on the map this year. After all these thankless centuries she deserves some recognition!&#x201d;</p><p>A certain excitement filled the room. Each board member glanced across the table and smiled. There was an obvious consensus: this could be fun.</p><p>Mary Ann raised her hand and stammered. &#x201c;No . . . no, you don&#x2019;t understand. I don&#x2019;t really want to--&#x201d;</p><p>Louisa, thinking she&#x2019;d do her old friend a good turn and show her support for this new idea, broke in with &#x201c;I agree! How delightful!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All in favor, raise your hand,&#x201d; said Arthur.</p><p>Mary Ann kept her arms folded across her chest while all the others raised their hands. While they assumed she was just being polite and didn&#x2019;t want to vote for her own idea, she was making a mental note to change one of her debate lesson plans. Reductio ad absurdum, indeed--this one can backfire, kids.</p><p>She felt like slinking down into the conference-room chair like one of her bewildered students. She&#x2019;d be the laughingstock of Crossing Trails. Why couldn&#x2019;t she just keep her mouth shut and let Hank Fisher retire? It wasn&#x2019;t even Thanksgiving, and her husband, George, would still be laughing at her--a woman in a Santa suit--when the glittering silver ball dropped in Times Square. He would never let her live this one down.</p><p>&#x201c;Mary Ann,&#x201d; said Carol Sampson warmly, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ll be a wonderful Anna Claus. Thank you so much for volunteering.&#x201d;</p><p>The chairman smiled and began singing an old familiar tune, to slightly different lyrics: &#x201c; &#x2018;Anna Claus is coming to town.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p><p>Mary Ann dropped her purse on the kitchen table. The television was broadcasting the evening news in the living room, so she hung her coat in the hall closet and walked in that direction. As she expected, George was getting a head start on a good night&#x2019;s sleep. His bad leg, wounded in Vietnam, was fully extended. It seemed to hurt less that way. His left hand rested on the head of his aged Labrador, whom their son, Todd, had named &#x201c;Christmas&#x201d; years ago. The old dog looked up lovingly at Mary Ann, and his big, thick tail brushed slowly back and forth across the floor. After giving Christmas an acknowledging pat, she gently nudged her husband&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;George.&#x201d;</p><p>Startled, George sheepishly rattled the paper that rested on his lap as if to wake himself. &#x201c;Oh, I must have fallen asleep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, you must have,&#x201d; Mary Ann teased. &#x201c;Did you and Christmas get Todd moved into his new apartment? I can&#x2019;t believe he&#x2019;s already back in Crossing Trails. His time at Heartland sure went by fast,&#x201d; she marveled. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re going to miss him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I called. He said he was already moved in.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;By himself?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess so. I doubt that funny-looking little dog of his was much help. What&#x2019;s her name? Elle?&#x201d; George stretched. &#x201c;How was your board meeting?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not good.&#x201d; She paused, thoughtful. &#x201c;Actually, it was awful.&#x201d;</p><p>George looked up, surprised. Library board meetings had been described by Mary Ann in a lot of ways over the years, but never like that. &#x201c;Why? What happened?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You promise to not make this worse for me than it already is?&#x201d;</p><p>George sat up straight, now wide awake and intrigued. If Mary Ann was expecting him to be critical of her, George had a pretty good idea what had happened. The affronted look on her face all but sealed his suspicions. &#x201c;You were fussing with someone, and they kicked you off the board or you quit?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Mary Ann scolded. &#x201c;Why in the world would you say such a thing?&#x201d;</p><p>George cocked his head sideways, as if surprised she had to ask. &#x201c;Well, let me see.&#x201d; He held his right fist up and extended one finger at a time as he ticked off his points. &#x201c;Number one, you&#x2019;re outspoken. Two, you&#x2019;re bright but like to debate. Three, you champion your principles at the expense of other people&#x2019;s principles. Any of those applicable? Am I getting warm?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You make me sound wicked.&#x201d;</p><p>George reached out and pulled her closer to him. When she was close enough, he gave her a hard tug so that she fell onto his lap. He whispered into her ear, &#x201c;Deliciously wicked. Just the way I like it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;George, I&#x2019;ve been a real idiot, and now I have myself in a fix.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, what happened?&#x201d;</p><p>She rested her head on his chest. &#x201c;They wanted to fire Hank from being Crossing Trails&#x2019; Santa Claus. After all these years! Can you imagine that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not surprised.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They said he was too old. They said his oxygen tubes would scare the children.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They may be right. It&#x2019;s time for Hank to turn over the reins, but they never should have said that to you.&#x201d;</p><p>Mary Ann squirmed from George&#x2019;s grip and leaned away from him. &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They slighted someone you love!&#x201d; His eyes sparkled. &#x201c;That will provoke the Charge of the Light Brigade, with you riding front and center, saber rattling, accepting neither prisoner nor counsel. Shoot first. Ask questions later.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Am I that bad?&#x201d; When he only smiled but didn&#x2019;t answer, she returned her head to his chest. &#x201c;Still, I can&#x2019;t imagine Christmas without Hank.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hank knows that he needs to hang up the red suit. He&#x2019;s afraid he&#x2019;ll drop some kid on the floor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did he tell you that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure. Last week.&#x201d;</p><p>She looked at George, surprised. &#x201c;I sure wish you&#x2019;d told me that before I opened my mouth at the meeting. So what does he want to do?&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Minus 148 Degrees: The First Winter Ascent of Mount McKinley</h2><p>Classic tale of dramatic near-death experiences in the harshest of conditions.</p><p>"This finely crafted adventure tale runs on adrenaline but also something else: brutal honesty." -- <i>-- Wall Street Journal </i></p><h2>Follow Me - Meeting Jesus in the Gospel of John - Student workbook</h2><p>Bible Study of the Gospel of John</p><p></p><h2>Mary Engelbreit&#39;S Home Companion Book</h2><p>A guide to decorating with style covers kitchens, windows, walls, children&#39;s rooms, and workspaces</p><p>Here, Engelbreit shares the philosophy she follows in life: "It's your house and it should be filled with the things and the colors that make you feel good."

As with any good whodunit, Faron's engaging style and true-life adventures will have you turning pages. In short, every gumshoe's search should begin here.</p><p>Fay Faron first discovered her proclivity for detective work when the houseboat she'd just bought sank in Sausalito's Richardson Bay and it behooved her to track down the boat's elusive previous resident. She is the founder of the Rat Dog Dick Detective Agency (seriously!) in San Francisco, and a regular guest on <i>Oprah!</i>. She has written an informative, entertaining, nay, hilarious guide for anyone writing about detectives and missing persons (MPs). <i>Missing Persons</i> tells us who is most likely to become a private investigator (PI), who is likely to go missing (or merely misplaced), and who would want to find them (hint: "the working PI's motto often is 'The client is not always right and often is not even sane.'"). We learn how and why people hide their whereabouts, and how to go about locating them. While 95 percent of a PI's work is done sitting at a desk, says Faron, "sooner or later your detective has to actually get off his duff and go out into the real world and burn up some calories." This is called "gumshoeing," and includes such scintillating activities as surveillance ("newspaper reading, coffee drinking and bladder rending") and dumpster-diving ("although I'd sooner admit to wearing Tan- In-A-Bottle to my high school reunion, I will concede there are lots of treasures to be found in day-to-day debris"). The appendices list PI licensing requirements by state and state laws regarding taping telephone conversations and such, so you don't make a fool of yourself. Faron works in fabulous, unbelievable examples from her 15 years in the business and lines such as this, about one MP who was discovered to be alive, not dead: "Dr. Mort had not, in fact, taken a dirt nap."Fay Faron runs the Rat Dog Dick Detective Agency in San Francisco, and writes the syndicated column &#34;Ask Rat Dog.&#34;</p><h2>Eyewitness: Weather</h2><p>Full-color photographs.

Godfathers of the current alternative scene, they reinvented rock in the post-punk era, creating a new sound - dark, hypnotic, intense that would influence U2, Morrissey, R.E.M., Radiohead and many others. The band&#39;s image, once subversive and alienating, has become an internationally renowned &#39;look&#39; well documented by photographers Anton Corbijn, Kevin Cummins and graphic designer Peter Saville. Inspired by the attitude, energy and sound of Punk, particularly the Sex Pistols, Peter Hook and his old school friend Bernard Sumner started a band which continues to influence popular music 35 years later, uniting with a gifted lead-singer and lyricist, Ian Curtis, and a brilliant drummer, Stephen Morris. With some cobbled together instruments and a clapped out old van, four young lads from Manchester and Salford shared the same vision and created their own unique sound in pubs and clubs first across the north-west, then across the whole of Britain, until in 1980 they had released two albums and were on the cusp of touring America. Then Ian Curtis committed suicide leaving everyone around him bereft. In the frank, no-holds-barred style, Peter &#39;Hooky&#39; Hook gives us the inside story of life with Joy Division. He talks with eye-opening candor and reflection about the suicide of Ian Curtis: often seen as the &#34;intellectual one&#34;, to Peter and the band he was just &#34;one of the lads&#34; and the burden of balancing his epilepsy and the demands of his domestic life only really emerged when it was too late. He covers the band&#39;s friendships and fall-outs; their rehearsals and recording sessions; and the larger-than-life characters who formed a vital part of the Joy Division legend: Tony Wilson, Rob Gretton, Martin Hannett, and more. An intimate account of Joy Division that is perfect for die-hard fans.

An investigation that takes him over the border to Mexico and into a dangerous labyrinth of shifting identities and deadly corruption.</p><p>It should have been his case. But the LAPD brass are all over the crime scene so fast that Detective Harry Bosch scarcely gets a look at the body before the case is taken out of his hands. The corpse in the motel room is identified as that of a narcotics officer who&#39;d been missing for several days. Rumor has it that Internal Affairs had been after him, that he&#39;d crossed over, fronting a new drug called black ice that has infiltrated from Mexico. As the media mount a frenzy of speculation, the police department hastily declares the death a suicide. Bosch isn&#39;t so sure. The note - &#34;I found out who I was&#34; - is cryptic at best. The motel room has clearly been wiped clean of all fingerprints except the victim&#39;s. And the cop&#39;s widow, a strong and lovely woman who blames herself for not knowing her husband better, brings out the idealist in Harry. He starts his own investigation, working without authorization or backup, and it takes him deep into the L.A. night and then across the Mexican border to Mexicali. The dead narc&#39;s childhood in the Mexicali barrio is one of many keys Bosch must turn as he plunges into mysteries of identity and enters a game far more complex and lethal than just drug smuggling.The Bookcassetteï¿½ format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

No one knew what existed beyond the fortress of ice rimming the northern oceans, although theories abounded. The foremost cartographer in the world, a German named August Petermann, believed that warm currents sustained a verdant island at the top of the world. National glory would fall to whoever could plant his flag upon its shores. <br><br>James Gordon Bennett, the eccentric and stupendously wealthy owner of&nbsp;<i>The New York Herald</i>, had recently captured the world's attention by dispatching Stanley to Africa to find Dr. Livingstone. Now he was keen to re-create that sensation on an even more epic scale. So he funded an official U.S. naval expedition to reach the Pole, choosing as its captain a young officer named George Washington De Long, who had gained fame for a rescue operation off the coast of Greenland. De Long led a team of 32 men deep into uncharted Arctic waters, carrying the aspirations of a young country burning to become a world power. On July 8, 1879, the USS&nbsp;<i>Jeannette</i>&nbsp;set sail from San Francisco to cheering crowds in the grip of "Arctic Fever." <br><br>The ship sailed into uncharted seas, but soon was trapped in pack ice. Two years into the harrowing voyage, the hull was breached. Amid the rush of water and the shrieks of breaking wooden boards, the crew abandoned the ship. Less than an hour later, the&nbsp;<i>Jeannette&nbsp;</i>sank to the bottom,and the men found themselves marooned a thousand miles north of Siberia with only the barest supplies. Thus began their long march across the endless ice&#x2014;a frozen hell in the most lonesome corner of the world. Facing everything from snow blindness and polar bears to ferocious storms and frosty labyrinths, the expedition battled madness and starvation as they desperately strove for survival. <br><br>With twists and turns worthy of a thriller,&nbsp;<i>In The Kingdom of Ice</i>&nbsp;is a spellbinding tale of heroism and determination in the most unforgiving territory on Earth.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, August 2014:</strong> In the last few decades of the 19th century, the world looked very different from the way it does now. Parts of the map were unfilled--chief among those spaces was the North Pole, which many believed contained warm currents that might provide safe passage. Enter James Gordon Bennett, the wealthy and eccentric owner of the <em>New York Herald</em>. Bennett--who was responsible for sending Stanley in search of Livingstone--wanted to produce another thrill for his readers, so he funded a naval expedition to reach the pole. Captained by George Washington De Long, the <em>U.S.S. Jeannette</em> shipped out in 1879 toward glory and parts unknown. The <em>Jeannette</em> became encased in ice, but the adventure was only just beginning. Author Hampton Sides does a masterful job of setting up the voyage against the backdrop of the Gilded Age, developing fascinating characters along the way, and delivering a true triumph of narrative nonfiction. Drawing on journal entries, letters, and eventually his own visit to the region, Sides paints a vivid, moving, and breathless portrait of the crew of the <em>Jeannette</em>.

King is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of eight Mary Russell mysteries, four contemporary novels featuring Kate Martinelli, and the bestselling novels <b>A Darker Place, Folly, </b>and<b> Keeping Watch.</b> She lives in northern California.<i>Chapter One</i><br> Earlier that morning, the call had come while Inspector Kate Martinelli of the San Francisco Police Department was in the middle of a highly volatile negotiation.<br><br> "I'll hurt myself," the person on the other side of the room threatened.<br><br> "Now, that's no good." Kate's response employed the voice of patient reason that she had clung to for the last few minutes, as she desperately wished that the official negotiator would return and take command.<br><br> "Yes it is good." Her opponent saw with crystal clarity that self-destruction was a powerful weapon against Kate.<br><br> "Now, think about it, sweetie. If you hurt yourself, it's going to hurt."<br><br> The mop of curly yellow hair went still as the green eyes narrowed in thought, and Kate's soul contracted with the weird mixture of stifled laughter and heart-wrenching submission that had welled up inside ten thousand times over the past three years and ten months: The child was so like her mother--her looks, her intelligence, her innate sensitivity--she might have been a clone. Kate pushed the sensation away from her throat and said, still reasonable, "We'd all be sad if you were hurt, but you would be the one that was hurting. Now, if you let me lift you down from there, we'll talk about whether you're old enough and careful enough to play with those things."<br><br> "I'm careful," the child insisted.<br><br> "You come down, and then we'll talk about it," Kate repeated. A good negotiator only retreated so far, then stood firm.<br><br> It worked. Nora's chubby little arms went out and Kate moved quickly forward before her daughter tumbled off the high shelf. The arms clung to her fiercely, giving lie to the small person's declaration of fearlessness; Kate's arms clung just as hard.<br><br> Then she set the child firmly down and bent to look directly into those large, bright eyes, arranging her face so she would look very serious. "Nora, you must never do that again. It really would make me very, very sad if you hurt yourself falling down."<br><br> "And Mamalee."<br><br> "Yes, and Mama Lee, too." In fact, Kate was wondering if it might even be possible to negotiate her way into an agreement with Nora that Lee not be told about this little episode, but voices in the hallway and the sounds of the front door, followed by the approach of Lee's uneven footsteps, told her that it wasn't going to happen.<br><br> And indeed, the moment Lee cleared the doorway Nora popped out from behind Kate and informed her mother, "I climbed up high and Mamakay said that if I comed down we'd talk about if I could play with the dollies."<br><br> "I had to pee," Kate explained guiltily. "Thirty seconds, and when I came out the little monkey was up on the sideboard."<br><br> There ensued a protracted discussion as to the nature of trust, which was Lee's current teaching concept, and Kate had to admit, the child seemed to follow most of what her PhD, psychotherapist mother had to say on the matter. After she'd put her two cents' worth in, telling Lee about Nora's willingness to harm herself if it got her the delicate Russian nesting dolls, the discussion turned to the evils of blackmail. That, however, seemed to exhaust the child's patience, and she interrupted to demand that she be given the dolls.<br><br> "Not today," Lee said firmly. And over the protest, she explained, "If you hadn't climbed up high after them, if you'd just asked us about it, we might have said yes. But because you didn't, you're going to have to wait until tomorrow."<br><br> It was scary, Kate reflected not for the first time, how reasonable the child was: She pouted for a count of five, then allowed Lee to take her hand and lead her to the kitchen for a discussion of the weekend itinerary. Kate watched the two blond heads, the two slim bodies, the two sets of unreliable legs--one pair made so by youth, the other by a bullet--as her partner and their daughter settled in to discuss the relative lunchtime merits of turkey versus peanut butter.<br><br> Only then did she remember the phone call that she'd been on her way to answer when she'd glanced up to see the little body clambering high above the hardwood floor. She went over and punched the playback on the machine, and heard the dispatcher ask for her to call back, then add that she was going to call Al Hawkin as well. Kate didn't bother calling Ops, just hit Al's number on the speed dial. From the sound of the background noise when he picked up, he was in the car.<br><br> "Hawkin."<br><br> "Hey, Al," she said. "What did the Ops center want?"<br><br> "There's a body in the park--but it's the other side of the bridge."<br><br> "In Marin? So why call us?"<br><br> "Jurisdiction over there's an absolute bitch, but the vic lives over here and it looks like the park's just the dump site. So until we find the murder site, the Park Police investigator, and his supervisor, thought we should be brought in early, in case it ends up in our hands. They've already called our Crime Scene out for the site."<br><br> "Marin's going to have a fit."<br><br> "Our side's going to have the fit. I'd say, if you're doing anything, don't break up your Saturday."<br><br> "No, I should come if you're going, and I think Lee's finished with her clients for the day. Let me just check with her."<br><br> "Why don't you call me if you don't want me to come by? I'm about twenty minutes out." Which meant he'd not been home when he got the call--he lived about an hour south of the city, but knowing Al, he had his full kit with him wherever he'd been, briefcase, forms, gun.<br><br> "Will do. Do you want anything to eat?"<br><br> "Jani and I had a big breakfast, so no thanks."<br><br> "Twenty minutes."<br><br> "Oh, and Kate? The guy said to wear sturdy shoes and a warm coat."<br><br> "Thanks for the warning."<br><br> Lee scowled at the news that Kate would be leaving, but she'd known that Kate was on call, and she'd been with Kate long enough to know that sometimes life came first, and sometimes death did.<br><br> "Can you call if you're not going to be home for dinner? I told Nora we'd make pizza."<br><br> Nora was neatly distracted from the disappointment of Kate's departure by the reminder. "Yay, pizza!" she cried with a jubilant dance.<br><br> "It should be fine, it may not even be our case, depending on how the lines are drawn on jurisdiction, but the d.b. lived here, so they offered us a look-in."<br><br> "Oh, what a treat," Lee said dryly.<br><br> "What's a deebee?" Nora piped up.<br><br> Kate gave her partner an apologetic glance and opened her mouth to try for an explanation about dead bodies that would satisfy the child without planting macabre images in her impressionable mind, but Lee had already begun with, "Well, you see, sweetheart . . ." Kate slipped away, letting Lee deal with that particular matter.<br><br> Seventeen minutes later, Kate was out in front of the house, waiting for Al Hawkin's car to round the corner. A neighbor came along the sidewalk at a snail's pace, a dog leash in one hand and a toddler's hand in the other. She greeted Kate, reminding Kate of the planning meeting the following week at the preschool, inquiring about the acupuncturist Lee had mentioned a while ago, and tossing out ideas for the upcoming street fair. The entire conversation was held with the woman moving slowly past, never quite coming to a halt while dog and toddler explored the street; the trio continued at the same pace until the corner, when they turned toward the park.<br><br> Kate smiled, and raised a hand to wave to another neighbor. She and Lee had lived in the Noe Valley neighborhood for nearly eight years, and never had a place felt more like home. Kate rarely thought anymore about the magnificent house on tony Russian Hill where they had once lived, cop and therapist rubbing shoulders with the city's cream of socialites and politicos. That place had been Lee's, an inheritance from her overbearing and disapproving mother, and had looked out on two incomparable bridges, San Francisco Bay, Alcatraz Island, and Mount Tamalpais in the background. When Lee finally decided to put the house on the market, it had sold before the print was dry on the advertisement, for more money than Kate could envision.<br><br> They had traded the gorgeous, intricately constructed Arts and Crafts-style house with the million-dollar view for a tumbledown Victorian whose chief virtue in their eyes was also, as far as the listing agent was concerned, its chief drawback: The elderly couple who had lived in the house all the five decades of their married life, unwilling to abandon the upper levels but increasingly unable to negotiate the stairs, had hacked up the back rooms and put in a tiny elevator.<br><br> Kate turned to gaze affectionately at the house. Most buyers would have been daunted by the enormous expense of ripping out the mechanism and restoring the rooms to their previous condition, but for Kate, the one-person elevator had been her personal deciding factor in its favor: Lee would never have agreed to its installation, but if it was here anyway, well, why not make use of it? The personal lift, just large enough for the wheelchair during Lee's bad times, was an unvoiced recognition that the effects of the bullet through Lee's spine, twelve years before, would never completely leave them; it had made their lives infinitely simpler.<br><br> The enormous price brought by the Russian Hill house had enabled them to make other renovations, from new carpeting and fresh paint to a complete rebuilding of the kitchen. Lee had ...</p><h2>The Killer, Vol. 1</h2><p>A man solitary and cold, methodical and unencumbered by scruples or regrets, the killer waits in the shadows, watching for his next target. And yet the longer he waits, the more he thinks he&#39;s losing his mind, if not his cool. A brutal, bloody and stylish noir story of a professional assassin lost in a world without a moral compass, this is a case study of a man alone, armed to the teeth and slowly losing his mind.</p><p>In 1998, Matz&#x2019;s hit series, The Killer, with artist Luc Jacamon, made its comic book debut. It became a bestseller that found its way onto the shelves of bookstores in many countries, all the way to the USA with Archaia. It was then optioned by Paramount for a movie that has drawn the interest of director David Fincher ("The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"). Matz has also created a new line of comic books, Rivages/Casterman/Noir, which are adaptations of noir novels. But Matz&#x2019;s day job for the last 15 years has been to write for the videogame industry, as he has been an employee at Ubisoft. Now in charge of the writing department, Matz has been involved with games such as &#x201c;Splinter Cell,&#x201d; &#x201c;Ghost Recon,&#x201d; &#x201c;Rainbow Six,&#x201d; &#x201c;Prince of Persia,&#x201d; and the &#x201c;Assassin&#x2019;s Creed&#x201d; series.A bestseller in Europe, <i>Le Tueur</i> has finally reached America. A French hit man has long been at the top of his game, but the psychic weight of his crimes is slowly catching up with him, and, after he botches one job and attracts a policeman determined to bring him down, he may be breaking down just when he needs his skills the most. The French have long been masters of moody noir films like <i>Band of Outsiders</i> or <i>Le Samourai</i>, so <i>The Killer</i> carries some heavy expectations. Fortunately, Jacamon's art is more than up to the task. His layouts are exciting, equally adept at choreographing brutal action, placing the camera for maximum suspense, and playing with panel borders to convey the protagonist's gradual mental breakdown. His figures are reminiscent of Darwyn Cooke's (<i>The Spirit</i>) cartoony realism, using deceptively simple lines and expressive faces to suggest far greater depth to the characters. Saturating panels with washed-out greens, blues and yellows, he changes palettes to establish shifts in location or flashbacks. The story is slight and a little disjointed, relying too heavily on self-consciously cool narration and abrupt flashbacks to pad out a by-the-numbers plot. Fans of Goddard or Melville should enjoy how well Jacamon captures their aesthetic on the page. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The format is essentially chronological covering my childhood years of the twenties, the Great Depression years of the thirties, the World War II years of the forties, and the postwar years to the present. However, it is not a straight narrative because it is a collection of vignettes that highlight certain events and moments of my life. These pieces were originally written at different points in my life, covering timely events or recollecting events of the past. So the chronology is sometimes blurred, the time jumping back and forth like flashbacks within a flashback. Through this "cinematic" method I hope to achieve a kind of impressionistic whole of my life story. Included also are poems which add a different perspective.

It is the lowest time for the Saxons. Defeated comprehensively by the Vikings who now occupy most of England, Alfred and his very small group of surviving followers retreat to the trackless marshlands of Somerset. There, forced to move restlessly to escape betrayal or detection, using the marsh mists for cover, they travel by small boats from one island refuge to another, hoping that they can regroup and find some more strength and support. Only Uhtred remains resolute. Determined to discover the enemy&#39;s strategies, he draws once again on his Viking upbringing, and attempts to enter the Viking camps. His plan is to become accepted enough by their leaders to be able to sit in their councils and uncover their plans. But once there, the attractions of his many friends among the Vikings coupled with his disillusion with the Saxons&#39; leadership and anger at Alfred&#39;s criticism of his own conduct, draws him back again to his allegiance to the Vikings, aided by his passion for one of them, the shadow queen of the title. &#34;The White Horse&#34;, an even more powerful and dramatic book than &#34;The Last Kingdom&#34;, brings both Uhtred and the Saxons&#39; dilemmas vividly to life.</p><p><p> As the last unvanquished piece of England, Wessex is eyed hungrily by the fearsome Viking conquerors. Uhtred, a dispossessed young nobleman, is tied to the imperiled land by birth and marriage but was raised by the Danish invaders&#x2014;and he questions where his allegiance must lie. But blood is his destiny, and when the overwhelming Viking horde attacks out of a wintry darkness, Uhtred must put aside all hatred and distrust and stand beside his embattled country&#x2019;s staunch defender&#x2014;the fugitive King Alfred.</p><p> New York Times bestselling author Bernard Cornwell&#x2019;s The Pale Horseman is a gripping, monumental adventure that gives breathtaking life to one of the most important epochs in English history.</p><p> &#x201c;Cornwell&#x2019;s characters are vividly drawn, betrayals lurk around every corner, the humor is as sharp as the swords, and the action is non-stop.&#x201d; &#x2014;NPR</p>Bernard Cornwell worked for BBC Television for seven years, mostly as a producer on the Nationwide programme, before taking charge of the Current Affairs department in Northern Ireland.

Although most evangelical traditions bar women from ordained ministry, many women have carved out unofficial positions of power in their husbands' spiritual empires or their own ministries. The biggest stars&#x2015;such as Beth Moore, Joyce Meyer, and Victoria Osteen&#x2015;write bestselling books, grab high ratings on Christian television, and even preach. In this engaging book, Kate Bowler, an acclaimed historian of religion and the author of the bestselling memoir <i>Everything Happens for a Reason: And Other Lies I've Loved</i>, offers a sympathetic and revealing portrait of megachurch women celebrities, showing how they must balance the demands of celebrity culture and conservative, male-dominated faiths.</p><p>Whether standing alone or next to their husbands, the leading women of megaministry play many parts: the preacher, the homemaker, the talent, the counselor, and the beauty. Boxed in by the high expectations of modern Christian womanhood, they follow and occasionally subvert the visible and invisible rules that govern the lives of evangelical women, earning handsome rewards or incurring harsh penalties. They must be pretty, but not immodest; exemplary, but not fake; vulnerable to sin, but not deviant. And black celebrity preachers' wives carry a special burden of respectability. But despite their influence and wealth, these women are denied the most important symbol of spiritual power&#x2015;the pulpit.</p><p>The story of women who most often started off as somebody's wife and ended up as everyone's almost-pastor, <i>The Preacher's Wife </i>is a compelling account of women's search for spiritual authority in the age of celebrity.</p></p><p><b>Kate Bowler</b> is the author of <i>Blessed: A History of the American Prosperity Gospel</i> and the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling memoir <i>Everything Happens for a Reason: And Other Lies I've Loved</i> (Random House), which she wrote after being diagnosed with Stage IV cancer at age 35. She is associate professor at Duke Divinity School and lives in Durham, North Carolina. Twitter @KatecBowler"Bowler (<i>Everything Happens for a Reason</i>), professor at the Duke Divinity School, explains in this excellent analysis how some evangelical women have managed to become mega-ministry celebrities by transforming the limited roles allotted to women in evangelical culture into positions of power. Framing these women's work as that of wives, mothers, homemakers, and teachers&#x2015;rather than pastors or business leaders&#x2015;Bowler reveals how figures including Joyce Meyer, Beth Moore, and Victoria Osteen wield enormous power in their husbands' ministries, both on stage and behind the scenes. . . . [This] wonderful work provocatively considers what women gain and lose in becoming 'market-ready' for evangelical communities."

Whether you are a student of American religious history, a follower of popular Christian culture, or someone who has never thought twice about the women who grant legitimacy to the powerful men they marry, Kate Bowler will take you places you could not have gone on your own. She is a scholar who knows how to tell a story, a theologian who can make you laugh out loud, and the kind of listener who earns the trust of her subjects and readers alike. She won't tell you what to think, but she'll introduce you to people you'll never forget, and you'll be the better for it."<b>&#x2015;Barbara Brown Taylor, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Learning to Walk in the Dark </i></b><br><br>"This is a surprising book: scholarly yet accessible, critical yet kind, feminist yet not ideological. Kate Bowler managed to help me understand these women, marvel at these women, and even respect the creative tenacity of these women, when on my own, and without her guidance I would have only ever criticized these women&#x2015;and for that I am grateful. She is a marvel."<b>&#x2015;Nadia Bolz-Weber<i>, New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Pastrix: The Cranky, Beautiful Faith of a Sinner and Saint</i></b><br><br>"With her characteristic blend of sympathy and searing analysis, scholarly rigor and utterly absorbing prose, Kate Bowler explains how enterprising women in 'megaministry' built their own theological kingdoms by embracing strategies of celebrity&#x2015;a Faustian bargain that has exposed them to the starkest vulnerabilities and trade-offs. This is a masterful book."<b>&#x2015;Darren Dochuk, author of <i>Anointed with Oil: How Christianity and Crude Made Modern America</i></b><br><br><i>"The Preacher's Wife</i> is a smart, thought-provoking account of contemporary women in megaministry, but it's also a book about the extraordinary pressures faced by all women, religious or not, today. With empathy and humor, Kate Bowler paints an unforgettable portrait of a fascinating group of evangelical women."<b>&#x2015;Catherine Brekus, author of <i>Strangers and Pilgrims: Female Preaching in America, 1740&#x2013;1845 </i></b><br><br>"With the accuracy of a historian, the insight of a scholar, and the heart of a Christian leader, Kate Bowler explores an influential phenomenon within Christianity in this challenge to today's church leaders. Readers of Bowler's previous books will not be disappointed."<b>&#x2015;Phil and Debbie Waldrep, founders of the <i>Women of Joy </i>ministry</b><br><br>"Filled with vivid human portraits, <i>The Preacher's Wife</i> is an absolute joy to read. Kate Bowler's account demonstrates, with great insight, the difficult balance megachurch women must constantly maintain, stepping into the limelight but never appearing to monopolize it. The book advances our understanding of evangelicalism and women's role in modern American religion."<b>&#x2015;Margaret Bendroth, author of <i>The Last Puritans: Mainline Protestants and the Power of the Past</i></b><br><br>"Kate Bowler provides an extraordinarily rich portrait of Christian female celebrities who are breaking church barriers on women's roles even as they uphold a carefully crafted stance of holy obedience. With generosity, perceptiveness, and wit, Bowler analyzes these women in all their intricacy as they manage beauty, sexuality, family life, and money on a public stage. A truly splendid book."<b>&#x2015;R. Marie Griffith, author of <i>Moral Combat: How Sex Divided American Christians and Fractured American Politics</i></b><br><br>"Fascinating, insightful, and utterly illuminating, this book shows why historians need to be involved in all of our theological conversations. Kate Bowler throws the lights on, bringing us a desperately needed perspective on the invisible rules governing how, when, and which women lead in the religious marketplace. As a woman in public ministry, I'm grateful for the clarity and challenge of Bowler's findings as well as her kindness, camaraderie, and wisdom. I won't see my work the same way again."<b>&#x2015;Sarah Bessey, author of <i>Jesus Feminist </i>and <i>Miracles and Other Reasonable Things</i></b></p><h2>Bella&#39;s Gift: How One Little Girl Transformed Our Family and Inspired a Nation</h2><p><p><strong>Rick and Karen Santorum&#x2019;s inspiring story of life with Bella, their special-needs youngest child</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Four days after Rick and Karen Santorum welcomed their eighth baby into the world they were given the devastating news that their little girl, Bella, was going to die.

Compelling and intimate, &#34;The First Stone&#34; challenges the blind orthodoxy of today&#39;s new breed of feminists and tells of the cost of party-line politics over the more complex matters of human relations.</p><p><i>The First Stone</i> is at once an account of one of Australia's most explosive sexual harassment cases and an investigation into soul of sexual politics. To provide the framework of her inquiry, Helen Garner uses the very public case of a University of Melbourne college master accused of sexual harassment by two of his students. After reading about the charge in the newspaper, Garner, a longtime feminist, impulsively wrote a letter of support to the accused man. The letter was made public and in the wake of much criticism over her support of the man, Garner set out to explore the women's claims. Along the way she uncovers issues that challenge her notions of feminism, political activism, gender relations, and power dynamics. With a journalist's eye for detail, Garner leads the reader into a riveting examination of the nature of sex and power in contemporary society.A circuitous, speculative essay about an infamous sexual harassment case at an Australian university. Garner, a novelist, essayist, screenwriter of films directed by Jane Campion and Gillian Armstrong, and occasional journalist for Time Australia, was drawn into her obsession with this case by a 1992 newspaper report: A woman law student filed an indecent assault complaint with local police against the master of Ormond College at Melbourne Univesity. The student alleged that the man had put his hand on her breast while they danced at an end-of-the-school-year social. Garner, a self-described ``feminist pushing fifty,'' impulsively writes to the accused academic, deploring that ``our ideals of so many years [should be] distorted into this ghastly punitiveness.'' She seems surprised that these words come back to haunt her later attempts to probe the case as a journalist and effectively block her constructing a straightforward investigative account. Indeed, her unsuccessful efforts to arrange a single conversation with either of two women students who bring charges against the master is the slender thread on which she hangs her narrative. We follow Garner through a series of awkward interviews, from the hapless master (who is forced from his job, though Garner comes to believe he is innocent) to many others peripherally involved in the case. None of the informants speak to Garner on the record, and her own reliability as an observer is far from clear. She comes across as a self-absorbed woman who is admittedly overinvested in her identity as a rebel and a seeker during the '70s. The mother of a grown daughter, she remains both skeptical of men's ability to negotiate subtle sexual currents and vaguely contemptuous of young women in denial about the power of their own beauty and sexual magnetism. Though not without occasional insights about the inadequacies of the adversarial processes of law in resolving conflicts about sex and power, this is ultimately more frustrating than illuminating to read. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This cool-headed post-war reflection, from one of Nazi Germany&#x2019;s top panzer commanders, is rare enough. But then Hoth dives into his exact command decisions during Barbarossa&#x2014;still the largest continental offensive ever undertaken&#x2014;to reveal new insights into how Germany could and in his view should, have succeeded in the campaign.<br> <br>Hoth critically analyses the origin, development, and objective of the plan against Russia, and presents the situations confronted, the decisions taken, and the mistakes made by the army&#x2019;s leadership, as the new form of mobile warfare startled not only the Soviets on the receiving end but the German leadership itself, which failed to provide support infrastructure for their panzer arm&#x2019;s breakthroughs. <br> <br>Hoth sheds light on the decisive and ever-escalating struggle between Hitler and his military advisers on the question whether, after the Dnieper and the Dvina had been reached, to adhere to the original idea of capturing Moscow. Hitler&#x2019;s momentous decision to divert forces to Kiev and the south only came in late August 1941. He then finally considers in detail whether the Germans, after obliterating the remaining Russian armies facing Army Group Center in Operation Typhoon, could still hope for the occupation of the Russian capital that fall.<br><br>Hoth concludes his study with several lessons for the offensive use of armored formations in the future. His firsthand analysis, here published for the first time in English, will be vital reading for every student of World War II.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Preface<br>Maps<br><br>1 Introduction<br>2 Background<br>3 Destruction of the Enemy in the Border Areas, 22 June&#x2013;1 July<br>4 At Hitler&#x2019;s Headquarters, 26&#x2013;30 June 1941<br>5 From Minsk to the Western Dvina, 1&#x2013;7 July 1941<br>6 The Battle of Smolensk, 8&#x2013;16 July<br>7 Closing the Smolensk Pocket, 16 July&#x2013;18 August<br>8 Moscow, Kiev, or Leningrad<br>9 The Operations of the Battle of Vyazma<br><br>Conclusion<br>Epilogue : Hermann Hoth&#x2019;s Career after the Battle of Vyazma by Linden Lyons<br>Appendices<br>Notes<br>Bibliography<br></p><p>Hermann Hoth (1885-1971) began World War II in command of a motorized corps. During Operation Barbarossa he commander Panzer Group 3 of Army Group Center, and toward the end of 1941 was promoted to command of 17th Army. In June 1942 he was given command of 4th Panzer Army. In 1943, following the battle of Kursk, he was relieved of command. After serving six years in prison following the Nuremberg Trials, Hoth turned to writing and died at age 85 in Goslar, Germany.<br><br>Linden Lyons holds a master's degree in history from Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. He also studied German at the University of Freiburg and librarianship at the University of Canberra. He is passionate about languages, chess, and fencing, and lives in Melbourne with his family. He has also translated Panzer Operations by Hermann Hoth in the Wehrmacht im Kampf series, and is currently working on another translation for the series."Hoth&#x2019;s writing style is direct and to the point; yet it remains very readable and thought-provoking. He is a commander who cares very deeply about his soldiers and their well-being but also for the mentorship and development of his leaders... I would strongly recommend this book for any leader wanting to clearly understand what command (highlighted by bold, decisive action) entails in an operational context." (<i>Military Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The appendices include actual operational orders, but (unlike Guderian&#x2019;s book Panzer Leader) this is not a memoir - it is a masterclass in what happened and how to command armour. For that reason alone it should be bought and read by anyone who thinks they know about tanks, command or staff work as well as those with an interest in military history. 5 stars.&#x201d; (<i>Army Rumour Service</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;It is interesting in seeing how a senior commander viewed the machinations of higher command and the impact on campaign performance.&#x201d; (<i>Miniature Wargames</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A useful study on how the German leadership failed to provide adequate logistical support to capitalise on the breakthroughs made by the Panzer divisions.&#x201d; (<i>Classic Military Vehicles</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Hoth produced a more balanced view of the fighting that some of his contemporaries. The standard line taken by many German generals was that Hitler's decisions were almost always wrong, and if he had only left the direction of the war to them, then the result would have been different. Hoth, at least in the mid 1950s when this book was written, was more willing to admit that sometimes Hitler had a valid point, and some of his orders produced significant German victories.&#x201d; (<i>Historyofwar.org</i>)</p><h2>Follow Me: Experience the Loving Leadership of Jesus</h2><p>Who you follow says a lot about you.

I thoroughly endorse this book!&#x201d;-Henry T. Blackaby, author of Experiencing God WHO ARE YOU FOLLOWING? Leadership is a crucial issue. Who you follow says a lot about you. Even if your leader is yourself-which is what most of us prefer-people can immediately tell all sorts of things about you by who you follow. When Jesus presented the gospel, He always confronted people with the leadership issue. Whether the woman at the well, the rich young ruler, or Nicodemus, the bottom line that Jesus presented was the kingdom of God. To follow Him we must give up our own kingdoms-whether relationships, wealth, or power-and embrace God&#x2019;s kingdom. Jan Hettinga addresses the roadblocks that keep us from following Christ-our mistrust of authority, our fear of giving up control, and our unwillingness to face our resistance to God&#x2019;s kingdom. If you&#x2019;re tired of working to control your life and long to surrender to Jesus, Follow Me will challenge you to examine your life and submit to Christ as He leads you into the safety of His kingdom.Jan Hettinga lives in Snohomish, Washington, a community near Seattle.

The Northshore church planting network, or Northshore Network, began in 1996 and Dr. Hettinga continues to lead it today. Fourteen new churches have been started with several more about to launch.<br><br>The focus of Jan&#x2019;s teaching is the life-transforming power of the Kingdom Gospel of Jesus. Without surrender to the leadership of Jesus there can be no heart level change. Bowing and believing, also known as repentance and faith are the two essential sides of salvation. Jan speaks and trains leaders nationally and internationally on transformation and multiplication related topics.<br><br>In 2005, Jan earned his Doctor of Ministry Degree in Transformational Leadership at Bakke Graduate University in Seattle.
